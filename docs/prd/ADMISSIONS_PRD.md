# GT Admissions Application and Decision Support MVP PRD

**Status:** Approved for a synthetic four-week prototype, not live admissions

**Target versus implementation status:** Unless a paragraph is explicitly
dated, this document specifies approved target behavior rather than deployed
behavior. As of 2026-07-20, the current implementation is Milestone A: a local,
born-synthetic PostgreSQL/Supabase development stack with the B11B server-only
frontend adapter for profile and application setup. The exported `actions.ts`
path is exercised against local Auth through the Next cookie/server-client
boundary in CI; Next instrumentation fails startup when B11B is partially or
unsafely configured. Submitted-response completeness, uncapped profile lists,
directory-expiry idempotency, prohibited-field firewall commitments, and real
two-session save/submit races are covered. The later CogAT intake, routing,
Track B review (including the move to averaged rubric scoring), supervisor,
income-banded lottery allocation, admission/aid, and research-handoff stages are
in scope but remain target behavior, not current implementation; the shipped
contracts still use binary reviewer classification and have no allocation,
admission, aid, or research entities. The D-012
AWS/Cognito/Aurora/RDS Proxy/ECS design is the approved Milestone B target; it
is not deployed or provisioned by the current implementation, and this PRD
makes no claim that an AWS account or hosting route is available.

## Referenced Specifications and Identifier Registers

This PRD is the apex product specification. It states target behavior and scope;
it does not restate the schema, API signatures, or governance registers that
live in dedicated documents. Developers should treat the following as the
authoritative sources for the implementation detail this PRD references but does
not duplicate.

### Identifier registers

- **`D-###` decisions** — ratified design/scope decisions. Register:
  `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`. Load-bearing here: `D-012` (Supabase→AWS platform
  move, PostgreSQL retained), `D-013` (two-layer onboarding: reusable profile
  vs. immutable cycle application), `D-014` (six-stage family journey and four
  functional personas).
- **`E-###` evidence/assumptions** — evidence-and-assumption register with a
  class and status per entry. Register: `docs/ASSUMPTIONS_AND_EVIDENCE.md`.
- **`R#` / `H#` requirements** — core requirements (R1–R10) and
  hypothesis-level requirements (H1–H10). Register:
  `docs/project-requirements.md`; status summary in
  `docs/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`.
- **`B-##` external blockers** — GT/privacy/testing/future-decision blockers,
  cataloged in the Blocker List in this document and tracked in
  `docs/FEATURE_TO_REQUIREMENT_MAP.md`.

### Developer specifications not duplicated in this PRD

- **Data model / schema** — entity overview in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §5;
  field-level tracked-data map and migration specs in
  `docs/ONBOARDING_OVERHAUL_TICKETS.md`; authoritative DDL in
  `supabase/migrations/*`.
- **API / frontend↔backend interface** — RPC catalog, request envelope, and
  status/error contract in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §4.3; the executable
  contract is the Zod schemas and inferred types in `packages/contracts/src/`
  and the server-only actions in `apps/web/src/lib/onboarding/actions.ts` (the
  "B11B" local synthetic adapter).
- **AuthN/AuthZ and RLS** — principal model, seven business roles, ownership
  predicates, and the "no RLS-bypass credential" invariant in
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §7.
- **Versioning, hashing, and replay** — immutable successor versioning,
  hash-chained audit, canonicalization (`sha256+jcs-rfc8785+gt-v1`), and the
  `replay_decision` procedure in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §8.
- **Contributor workflow, branch tiers, and document precedence** — `AGENTS.md`
  and `PROJECT_CHARTER.md`.

Concrete contract values used across this document—workflow statuses, reason
codes, error codes, and the synthetic CogAT intake shape—are summarized in
"Workflow Status, Reason Codes, and Contract Summary" below and remain governed
by the code contracts above.

## MVP Definition

The target product is a role-based web application that replaces GT’s current
Finalsite-hosted admissions form with an in-house, low-friction application,
routes applicants after CogAT, supports independent Track B review, allocates
cohort seats through an income-banded lottery, records admission and
financial-aid outcomes, and produces the auditable data needed to later
estimate GT’s program effect separately from its selection effect.

It does not administer CogAT or unilaterally change Track A capability policy;
cutoffs, bands, seat counts, and aid rules remain GT-owned inputs the product
integrates as configured values. It does not by itself prove the
program-versus-selection separation — it produces the eligibility, allocation,
and research-participation data a prospective two-stage evaluation would consume
(see "Allocation and Evaluation").

### Background and Motivation

The current GT application runs on Finalsite and imposes avoidable friction that
gives families reasons to abandon it partway. The open-ended essay, an
unexplained ~$100 application fee, and general information overload each create
an exit point, and the "save and finish later" affordance makes leaving easy.
Bringing the application in-house lets GT remove or defer that friction — no
required essay in the base application, transparent fee handling, and
staged/streamed intake — and instrument the funnel so drop-off becomes
measurable rather than invisible.

Beyond the form, the product exists to give GT an admissions system whose
outputs can eventually distinguish the program's causal effect from the effect
of selecting already-advantaged students. It does this by keeping eligibility
capability-based and firewalled from family advantage, then allocating seats
through a lottery structured to support a prospective, two-stage evaluation. The
end-to-end pipeline is:

1. Every applicant takes the CogAT.
2. Applicants at or above the Track A cutoff receive an automatic admission
   offer, with financial aid allotted as configured.
3. Applicants in the Track B band — or showing exceptional strength in a single
   CogAT battery — are invited to complete the Track B application.
4. The Track B application requests an existing artifact of the child's talent;
   a family without one instead submits a bounded structured narrative.
5. Two reviewers score each Track B submission against a rubric. If their scores
   diverge beyond tolerance a supervisor also scores it; narratives are scored by
   a supervisor from the start. The reviewer scores are averaged into the Track B
   review score.
6. Track B-eligible applicants (averaged score at or above the cutoff) are pooled
   and allocated by an income-banded lottery: seats are bucketed across
   household-size-adjusted income bands, applicants are placed by their intake
   finance data, and a lottery within each band determines seat offers.
7. Non-admitted Track B applicants are notified and offered a next-cycle
   application-fee waiver in exchange for joining a research study (three MAP
   tests alongside enrolled GT students).
8. The resulting data — non-admitted outcomes plus academic covariates — feeds
   the two-stage evaluation of program versus selection effect.

## MVP Personas and Functional Surfaces

The functional MVP has four role-specific experiences.

### Family / Guardian — Family Portal

- Create and reuse student/household profiles.
- Start, save, resume, review, sign, and submit a cycle application.
- Launch the external CogAT/admissions portal and return to view status.
- See the automatic routing result: Track A eligible (proceeds to an admission
  offer with financial-aid allotment), Track B Snapshot invited, or no current
  pathway.
- If invited, choose and complete the artifact or structured-narrative route.
- View pending actions, eligibility, explanation, and factual/procedural
  correction status.
- View the final admission decision: whether the income-banded lottery returned
  a seat offer and the associated aid, or — if not offered — the next-cycle
  fee-waiver research invitation.
- Receive in-app task/status/deadline notifications. Synthetic email
  notifications are an extension after MVP.

### Admissions Operator — Admissions Operations Dashboard

- Review application completeness and request factual correction.
- Enter/import and validate synthetic CogAT results.
- Resolve pending evidence/accessibility work.
- Manage reviewer assignments and replacements.
- Correct factual/procedural errors and rerun the locked rule.
- Configure synthetic seat counts and household-size-adjusted income bands used
  by the allocation lottery.
- Cannot directly override an eligibility outcome, a reviewer score, or a
  lottery draw. Valid CogAT entry and the final required review automatically run
  routing/finalization; the locked income-banded lottery and admission/aid
  publication then run automatically from finalized eligibility.

### Reviewer — Track B Reviewer Workspace

- View an assigned-case queue with status and deadlines.
- Open only the assigned blind artifact/narrative evidence, age/grade band,
  selected domain, and approved accommodation route—not diagnosis or the full
  application.
- Save a draft six-dimension rubric with evidence citations.
- Submit irreversible per-dimension rubric scores.
- Abstain for conflict of interest or insufficient domain competence.
- Report a non-score evidence/accessibility blocker that pauses the case and
  routes it to admissions/family.
- Cannot see peer scores, aggregate score/count, applicant identity, full
  application context, or completed-assignment history in this MVP.

### Review Supervisor — Blind Third-Review Workspace

- Receives slot-three assignments: after an artifact-route disagreement or from
  the start for every narrative case.
- Uses the same blind evidence view, six-dimension rubric, citation, draft, and
  locked-submit behavior as a reviewer.
- Cannot see prior scores, discuss the case in-product, manage assignments,
  calibrate raters, or override the averaged review score.

Auditor/configuration, privacy-steward, accessibility-coordinator, and
school-leader role pages are not functional MVP surfaces. Their required
controls remain enforced through configuration, RLS, tests, and operational
work outside this page-level MVP; future dedicated surfaces remain in the
feature library.

The runtime authorization model defines seven business roles, of which only the
four personas above are functional MVP page surfaces. The full role vocabulary
(`packages/contracts/src/roles.ts`) is `family`, `admissions_operator`,
`reviewer`, `review_supervisor`, and three non-UI roles: `decision_service`
(the isolated engine principal that runs locked routing/finalization and
publishes decisions), `auditor`, and `privacy_steward`. The three non-UI roles
have no MVP page; their controls are enforced through RLS, `SECURITY DEFINER`
RPCs, configuration, and tests as noted above.

## End-to-End Page Workflow

### Stage 1 — Account Setup and Application

1. **Sign in / Student Selector**
   - Guardian enters the synthetic family portal.
   - Guardian creates or selects one of their student profiles.
2. **Student Information**
   - Name, date of birth, gender, current grade, requested entry year/grade.
3. **Educational Background**
   - Select current school from the versioned directory or use `other/not
     listed`; the page autofills the signed school name/type/address snapshot.
4. **Support, Plans, and Disclosures**
   - Accommodation/support-plan selections and conditional details.
   - Discipline/non-health withdrawal questions and conditional explanation.
5. **Family, Language, and Financial Intake**
   - Guardian relationship, household address, prior-GT relatives, home-language
     survey, synthetic household income, and household count.
6. **Review, Acknowledgements, Referral, and Signature**
   - Family reviews every persisted non-essay field, accepts the versioned
     statement, signs, and submits.
7. **Application Received**
   - Status becomes `awaiting_assessment`.
   - The page shows CogAT as the next required step.

### Stage 2 — External CogAT Handoff

1. **CogAT Launch**
   - MVP assumes a secure external admissions/testing portal opened from the
     family status page.
   - The actual GT portal, authentication, return URL, scheduling, and result
     exchange remain part of `B-01`; this assumption must change if the current
     GT workflow differs.
2. **Admissions CogAT Intake**
   - Admissions enters/imports and validates the synthetic result.
   - Missing/invalid results become pending correction, never a zero or
     negative eligibility result.
   - The result is recorded as an immutable, versioned assessment: instrument
     `COGAT_SYNTHETIC`; a composite score plus verbal, quantitative, and
     nonverbal battery scores (each `0–100` or null); and a `validity` of
     `pending`, `valid`, or `invalid`. Only a `valid` locked assessment drives
     routing; `pending`/`invalid` yield `assessment_needs_correction`. Battery
     and composite values are visibly synthetic and configurable (`B-01`,
     `B-03`).
3. **Automatic Routing**
   - A valid locked assessment automatically executes Track A and Track B
     invitation rules and immediately publishes the applicant-safe result.

### Stage 3 — Initial Routing Result

- **Track A eligible**
  - Family sees `track_a_eligible` and the applicable reason summary.
  - Track A eligibility proceeds directly to an automatic admission offer with
    financial aid allotted as configured (see Stage 8); it does not require a
    Snapshot and is not routed through the Track B lottery.
- **Track B Snapshot invited**
  - Family sees `track_b_snapshot_required`, why the invitation occurred, the
    deadline, and a choice of artifact or narrative route.
  - Invitation is not Track B eligibility or admission.
- **No current pathway**
  - Family sees an applicant-safe result and available factual/procedural
    correction or later-cycle re-entry information.

### Stage 4 — Track B Evidence Submission

1. **Route Choice**
   - Family selects existing artifact evidence or structured narrative fallback.
2. **Artifact Route**
   - Select domain(s), choose one or two fixed synthetic artifacts, and provide
     required provenance/assistance metadata.
3. **Narrative Route**
   - Select domain(s), one fixed synthetic narrative reference, and bounded
     observer context.
4. **Review and Submit**
   - Family reviews the Snapshot version and submits.
   - Status becomes `snapshot_under_review`.

Real artifact/narrative de-identification is deferred; the MVP uses
independently constructed synthetic fixtures. Any future live workflow must
meet `B-06`/`B-07`.

### Stage 5 — Blind Review and Supervisor Scoring

1. Reviewers work independently from their assigned queues.
2. Artifact cases begin with two reviewer slots; agreement finalizes the
   classification, disagreement creates one blind supervisor slot.
3. Narrative cases create two reviewer slots and one blind supervisor slot from
   the start.
4. Abstention creates a same-slot replacement and never counts as a score.
5. A reported evidence/accessibility blocker pauses aggregation and creates
   pending work rather than a low score.
6. When all required scores are locked, the engine averages them into the Track B
   review score, compares it to the configured minimum cutoff, and publishes the
   Track B eligibility notice.

### Stage 6 — Track B Eligibility Result

- **Track B eligible:** the averaged review score met the cutoff. Show the
  qualifying pathway, bounded reason summary, and correction route, and that a
  seat is not yet guaranteed — allocation follows in Stage 7.
- **Does not currently qualify:** show non-stigmatizing reasons, uncertainty,
  factual/procedural correction, and later-cycle re-entry information.
- **Pending family/internal action:** show the required owner, next action, and
  paused/escalated deadline without implying rejection.
- Eligibility is capability-only and is computed without any income, household,
  or other prohibited input. Allocation, admission, and aid follow in Stages 7–8
  and consume only finalized eligibility plus intake finance data.

### Stage 7 — Income-Banded Lottery Allocation

1. **Pooling**
   - All Track B-eligible applicants for the cycle are pooled once the required
     reviews are finalized.
2. **Banding**
   - Configured cohort seats are bucketed across household-size-adjusted income
     bands. Band definitions and seat counts are synthetic and configurable
     (`B-08`).
   - Each applicant is placed into a band using the finance data collected at
     intake. Income and household size are used only here, for allocation, and
     never in the capability-eligibility determination or any decision hash.
3. **Draw**
   - A locked, replayable lottery draws seat offers within each band. The draw
     seed, policy bundle, and inputs are retained so the allocation can be
     replayed.
4. **Result**
   - Each eligible applicant receives an offered or not-offered outcome.

### Stage 8 — Admission, Aid, and Research Handoff

- **Admission offer (Track A automatic, or Track B lottery seat):** show the
  offer, the allotted synthetic financial aid, and next steps.
- **Track B not offered:** notify the applicant, distinguish "not offered this
  cycle" from "not eligible," and present the next-cycle application-fee-waiver
  research invitation (see "Future Evaluation Handoff").
- **Pending family/internal action:** show the required owner, next action, and
  deadline without implying rejection.
- Admission and aid are cohort-allocation outcomes, not a judgment of the
  child's capability, and every applicant message avoids implying that a
  non-offer means "not gifted."

## Detailed Page and Decision Requirements

### Account Setup and Base Application Information

- The Family Application Portal separates reusable account/profile facts from
  the immutable snapshot signed for one application cycle.
- Submission binds the exact profile, private-context, school-directory, and
  final-submission versions used for that application. Later profile or
  configuration edits cannot rewrite the submitted application.
- Field vocabularies and requiredness remain versioned and configurable pending
  the authorities and validations identified in `B-06`, `B-08`, and
  E-063–E-065.
- **Reusable guardian-owned profile**
  - **Student identity**
    - Synthetic student identifier
    - Student name
    - Date of birth
    - Gender using a versioned configurable vocabulary; options and requiredness
      remain open
  - **Family/household**
    - Guardian relationship to child; guardian account identity comes from verified authentication
    - Primary household address
    - Whether relatives attend or attended GT School and, when yes, their names
  - **Home-language survey**
    - Language most often spoken at home
    - Language the child first learned
    - Language the child uses most often
    - Additional languages regularly spoken or understood
- **Cycle-specific application snapshot**
  - **Student/application**
    - Current grade
    - Requested school entry year and grade
  - **Educational background**
    - Current school chosen from a versioned directory
    - Directory school name, school type, and address copied into the signed snapshot
    - An explicit `other/not listed` route; directory source and maintenance owner remain open
    - Current-school enrollment date and prior-school history are not collected in this setup flow
  - **Special accommodations, learning plans, and disclosures**
    - Whether accommodations, learning plans, or other support are present
    - Versioned configurable multi-select accommodation and support-plan codes,
      with `other`
    - Bounded details about accommodations or challenges
    - Whether the student has been dismissed, suspended, placed on probation, or received another serious disciplinary sanction
    - Whether the student voluntarily withdrew for a non-health reason
    - A bounded explanation required when either disclosure is yes
    - This entire section is private operational context and hidden from
      eligibility reviewers; outside the guardian’s owner-scoped read, only
      explicitly authorized operational roles may read it, and those roles
      remain open under E-065
  - **Financial-aid intake**
    - Annual household income (exact amount versus configured band, currency, tax year, and requiredness remain open)
    - Number of people in the household (the household-count definition remains open)
    - No W-2 or proof document is requested or persisted during setup
    - Synthetic intake finance data drives income-band placement and synthetic
      aid allotment at allocation (Stages 7–8); real W-2/proof collection,
      retention, and live aid rules remain blocked by `B-08`
  - **Final submission**
    - Required-step checklist
    - Versioned acknowledgement text and acceptance timestamp:
      > I/We hereby state that the information contained herein is true and complete. I/We acknowledge that supplemental information may be required by the school and understand that our application will not be reviewed until supplement(s), if required, have been submitted.
    - Referral source, stored as operations-only and hidden from reviewers
    - Signature bound to the authenticated guardian, signed snapshot, statement version, and timestamp
    - The two general application essays are neither collected nor persisted
- **Purpose and eligibility firewall**
  - Outside a guardian’s owner-scoped access to their own records, private
    profile, support/disclosure, finance, referral, and signature context is
    readable only by explicitly authorized operational roles. Exact operational
    viewers remain open under `B-06`, `B-08`, E-064, and E-065.
  - Identity, gender, date of birth, household/address, relatives, language,
    accommodation/support, discipline/withdrawal, finance, referral, and
    signature fields are excluded from Track A/Track B eligibility inputs and
    decision hashes. Finance (income and household size) is used only at the
    allocation stage to band an already-eligible applicant for the lottery
    (Stage 7); it never enters an eligibility decision or its hash.
  - Every school-derived field—including directory ID, name, type, address,
    prestige, and `other/not listed` details—is excluded from eligibility.
    Only current/requested grade and entry year may control operational pathway
    availability; they cannot serve as capability evidence.
- After submission:
  - Display:
    > Application received. This is not an eligibility or admission decision. Your status page lists required next steps, deadlines, available accommodations, and assistance routes.
  - Show CogAT as the next required admissions step.
  - Target save/resume (auto-save and restore on return), correction,
    accessibility, and status tracking; accessible and translated routes still
    require `B-06` and E-024–E-027 validation.
  - Retain a decision trace showing the rule version, evidence, reviewer classifications, reason codes, and timestamps.
- Prototype scope:
  - Uses synthetic applicants, CogAT profiles, artifacts, and narrative evidence.
  - Stores only born-synthetic profile/application values and synthetic household-income/count fixtures.
  - Does not process live child data, W-2s/financial documents, fees, or real applications.
  - Targets COPPA-relevant minimization, parental-control, access, and deletion
    controls for validation. `B-06` and E-038 remain unresolved, so no COPPA or
    other legal-compliance claim is authorized.



## Track A

- The prototype preserves a locked, versioned, fictional Track A baseline: an
  applicant at or above the configured CogAT cutoff is Track A eligible.
- Track A eligibility proceeds directly to an automatic admission offer, with
  financial aid allotted per configured synthetic rules. Track A applicants do
  not enter the Track B Snapshot or the income-banded lottery.
- Enabling Track B must not change any eligibility result produced by that
  baseline.
- `B-01` remains unresolved. This PRD does not state GT’s current cutoff,
  CogAT form, workflow, retest rule, or correction process; all live values and
  process details remain open and configurable until authorized confirmation.



## Track B



### Invitation Rule

Within the synthetic prototype, an applicant below the configured fictional
Track A cutoff is invited to complete Track B when either:

- the CogAT composite falls within a predeclared promising band below the Track A cutoff; or
- at least one CogAT battery shows a predeclared strong domain profile despite the lower composite.

The invitation is not Track B eligibility or admission.

The prototype uses visibly synthetic values for:

- age/grade range;
- Track A cutoff;
- Track B promising band;
- battery-profile rule;
- example talent domains;
- reviewer anchors; and
- eligibility boundary.



### Talent Evidence Snapshot

The parent/guardian completes the Snapshot in 10–15 minutes.

- No new child testing, problem-solving, interview, or work is required.
- The parent selects 1–2 primary talent domains.
- Any demonstrable talent domain may contribute.
- Evidence must indicate exceptional domain talent plus learning rate, transfer, abstraction, or comparable capacity relevant to thriving in GT.



#### Route A — Primary Artifact Evidence

The parent provides one or two existing primary artifacts:

- video or audio;
- photo of original work or construction;
- writing, art, music, code, design, or project;
- existing schoolwork; or
- another child-produced artifact.

Required metadata:

- child’s age and artifact date;
- original task, prompt, or context;
- time spent;
- tools and materials;
- adult, teacher, peer, or AI assistance; and
- whether the behavior was repeated elsewhere.

Reviewers do not score production quality, equipment, formatting, awards, paid-program prestige, or access to expensive materials.

The prototype uses fixed synthetic artifact fixtures rather than real file uploads.

#### Route B — Bounded Structured Narrative Fallback

Used when the family has no existing artifact.

- A parent/guardian or other directly observing adult may submit the narrative.
- A third-party recommender is never required.
- Narrative body is limited to 400 words.
- Required factual header:
  - Relationship to child
  - Observation duration, frequency, and setting
  - Paid or unpaid relationship
  - Instruction or assistance provided
  - Opportunity context
  - Conflict of interest

Reviewers do not score writing quality, enthusiasm, superlatives, recommender prestige, paid enrichment, awards, or claims that the child is gifted.

The narrative route is testimonial evidence and receives no automatic point penalty.

### Review Rubric

Reviewers retain these dimensions separately:

- **Domain Expertise**
- **Learning rate**
- **Transfer or abstraction**
- **Independence**
- **Recurrence**
- **Evidence specificity**

Each dimension is scored numerically against anchored levels. The selected talent
domain code determines which domain-specific anchors apply to the Domain
Expertise dimension; domain identity or prestige is never itself a scored input.
The remaining dimensions use shared anchors across domains.

Under the target rubric, use of an accommodation or accessibility assistance
never reduces independence; independence refers only to authorship and
substantive contribution. This scoring noninterference rule does not establish
construct preservation, equal access, or route equivalence, which remain
subject to `B-06` and E-024–E-027 validation.

Each reviewer's per-dimension scores combine into that reviewer's rubric score,
and the required reviewers' scores are averaged into the Track B review score
that is compared to the configured minimum cutoff. This averaged rubric score is
a bounded, anchor-based review result for the submitted evidence; it is not a
holistic giftedness rating of the child, and no such holistic label is produced.
Anchor definitions, dimension weighting, the divergence tolerance, and the
cutoff are visibly synthetic and configurable (`B-04`).

### Independent Review

The synthetic target workflow uses simulated reviewer and supervisor accounts;
it does not assert live GT staffing. For the synthetic prototype, the artifact
route starts with two blind independent reviews and adds a blind third review
on disagreement, while the narrative route uses three blind reviews from the
start. Reviewer qualifications, live role assignments, staffing levels,
training time, calibration corpus/cadence, and monitoring ownership remain open
until `B-05`. Benchmark calibration and reviewer-severity monitoring are target
controls, not current GT operations.


#### Artifact Route

- Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 score independently.
- They cannot see each other’s scores.
- If their rubric scores agree within the configured tolerance, their average is
  the Track B review score.
- If they diverge beyond tolerance, a supervisor also scores the submission
  without seeing prior scores, and all three scores are averaged.



#### Narrative Route

- Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, and the supervisor score independently from the start.
- They cannot see each other’s scores.
- The three scores are averaged into the Track B review score.



### Reviewer Outcomes

- Each reviewer submits per-dimension rubric scores, not a binary vote.
- The averaged Track B review score determines the eligibility result:
  `qualifies` at or above the configured cutoff, otherwise
  `does not currently qualify`.

`pending correction` is a workflow state, not a score: invalid, inaccessible, or
uninterpretable evidence is routed to pending rather than rejected or scored low.

### Final Track B Eligibility

Track B eligibility requires:

1. passing the profile-aware CogAT Track B invitation rule;
2. exceptional evidence in at least one demonstrable talent domain;
3. at least one qualifying example of learning rate, transfer, or abstraction;
4. sufficient evidence specificity and child contribution; and
5. an averaged review score at or above the configured minimum cutoff.

Track B eligibility does not guarantee a seat; eligible applicants proceed to the
income-banded lottery allocation in Stage 7.

### Correction, Appeal, and Re-entry

- The MVP supports factual or procedural correction only: parents may correct
  factual or provenance errors, and a failed or unavailable accessibility route
  receives an accessible alternative or pending status without a claim of route
  equivalence.
- Substantive rubric-application appeal is disabled and deferred beyond MVP
  scope. No future appeal mechanism or reviewer assignment—including a “new
  trained reviewer” mechanism—is approved; the appeal model remains an open
  policy decision.
- Applicants may re-enter a later cycle with genuinely new existing evidence; re-entry is a manual staff-initiated action in the MVP, not an automated system rule.
- Correction, accommodation, research refusal, and re-entry cannot reduce future access.



### Allocation and Evaluation

- Track B seats are allocated by an income-banded lottery (Stage 7). Configured
  cohort seats are bucketed across household-size-adjusted income bands;
  applicants are placed by intake finance data; and a locked, replayable draw
  assigns seat offers within each band. All band, seat-count, and aid values are
  synthetic and configurable pending GT policy (`B-08`).
- Household income cannot affect Track A or Track B **capability eligibility**.
  It is used only at the **allocation** stage, after eligibility is finalized, to
  place an already-eligible applicant into an income band. This preserves the
  eligibility firewall while letting allocation pursue access goals.
- The lottery is the randomization mechanism the evaluation depends on: it
  produces offered-versus-not-offered variation among equally eligible Track B
  applicants.
- Track B broadens the eligible pool, but eligibility alone does not demonstrate
  program effect. The evaluation is a prospective two-stage design, not a single
  Track-A-vs.-Track-B comparison:
  1. Randomizing offer-versus-not-offered among equally eligible Track B
     candidates (via the lottery) estimates the Track B initial-offer/package
     effect.
  2. Comparing treated Track B against treated Track A is a service-fit
     noninferiority comparison, not a randomized causal estimate.

  Together, these two stages may support a decision to expand Track B or revise
  the test-only cutoff, but they do not prove that Track A and Track B have equal
  route-specific causal effects.
- The MVP's role is to produce the eligibility determination, the lottery
  allocation, and the research-participation data the evaluation consumes.
  Longitudinal follow-up and the causal analysis itself are performed downstream
  by evaluators; the MVP does not claim to have measured program effect.

#### Research Study and Evaluation Handoff

Non-offered Track B applicants are invited into a research study whose data the
two-stage evaluation consumes (Stage 8). The product operates the invitation and
data collection; the causal analysis itself is performed downstream by
evaluators. The design:

- Sufficient Track B demand/oversubscription (needed for randomized offer-versus-not-offered) is an external go-to-market (GTM) assumption, not a product blocker.
- Offered and non-offered Track B candidates would follow the same fall/winter/spring MAP testing schedule. MAP is the selected common future outcome measure, checked only with lightweight upper-tail and administration-consistency checks, not scored or used for eligibility.
- Non-offered candidates who submit all three MAP results would receive a proposed next-cycle application-fee waiver of about $100.
- Each MAP score submission would include a 2-3 minute structured questionnaire on schooling, tutoring, adaptive software, enrichment, and MAP prep since the prior test.
- Questionnaire responses are hidden from admissions and cannot affect eligibility or re-entry.
- These post-assignment resources/questionnaire responses are descriptive mechanism/substitution information for a future evaluator, not primary intent-to-treat controls.
- Pooling cohorts across cycles and handling drift belong to future analysts using existing operational metadata; the MVP does not add new applicant-facing fields to support this.
- Any future change to the Track B eligibility boundary (cutoff or promising band) would apply between admissions cycles only, never mid-cycle; would leave Track A unchanged; and would require both a positive Track B offer effect (stage 1) and A/B service-fit noninferiority (stage 2), plus capacity and applicant-wellbeing guardrails, before being adopted.



### Prohibited Eligibility Inputs

These inputs are prohibited from the **capability-eligibility** determination for
Track A and Track B (routing, review scoring, and the decision hashes). They do
not gate whether an applicant is eligible. Income and household size are used
later, at the **allocation** stage only, to place an already-eligible applicant
into an income band for the lottery (Stage 7); this is an access mechanism, not a
capability input, and never feeds an eligibility decision or its hash.

- Prose quality
- Income, household size, W-2s, aid status, address, or ZIP code *(income and
  household size are allocation-only inputs, never eligibility inputs)*
- School or recommender prestige
- Paid enrichment
- Awards or certificates
- Name, date of birth, gender, language, family structure, or prior-GT relatives
- Disability, diagnosis, accommodation/support-plan use, disciplinary history, or withdrawal history
- Domain prestige (domain code only selects rubric anchors and never scores)
- Parent advocacy
- Recommender access or absence
- Referral source
- Research-consent choices
- Demographic identity

- **Milestone B (approved target, deferred):** Cognito/RDS Proxy/Aurora
  binding and infrastructure, `B-06` live-use controls, `B-08` finance/proof
  policy, and production operations. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md`.
- Assessment/routing, Snapshot, review, decision/replay, and role-scoped
  frontend surfaces remain target work outside the completed Milestone A
  onboarding slice.
- Repository ownership, branch hierarchy, merge, and verification rules are
  maintained in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) and are not duplicated here.



### Blocker Labels

- `[GT INFO]` — We need GT policy, workflow, staffing, or data.
- `[TESTING RULE]` — We need a decision or expert input about CogAT or the Snapshot rubric.
- `[PRIVACY]` — We need approval before using real child data or uploads.
- `[FUTURE DECISION]` — We have intentionally left this outside the MVP.

These items do not stop the synthetic prototype when a placeholder is listed. They do stop live use or claims that the prototype matches real GT policy.

## Functional MVP Personas and Core User Stories

### Family / Guardian

- As a guardian, I want to reuse my child/household profile, complete one
  cycle-specific application across multiple pages, and resume after leaving so
  I do not repeatedly enter sensitive information.
- As a guardian, I want a clear external CogAT handoff and return status so I
  know what happens after application submission.
- As a guardian, I want Track A eligibility, Track B invitation, and no-current-
  pathway results clearly distinguished from admission or a guaranteed seat.
- As a Track B-invited guardian, I want to choose artifact or narrative evidence
  and review exactly what will be submitted.
- As a Track B-eligible guardian, I want the income-banded lottery seat offer (or
  non-offer) presented as an allocation outcome distinct from my child's
  eligibility, so a non-offer is never read as "not gifted."
- As a non-offered Track B guardian, I want the next-cycle fee-waiver research
  invitation explained clearly and framed as optional.
- As a guardian, I want pending actions and final reasons stated without
  labeling my child “not gifted,” and I want factual/procedural errors corrected
  through a traceable rerun.

### Admissions Operator

- As an admissions operator, I want a completeness queue and factual-correction
  requests so missing data is not treated as low capability.
- As an admissions operator, I want to enter/import and validate CogAT results
  so the locked routing rules run automatically from a valid assessment.
- As an admissions operator, I want to resolve pending evidence/accessibility
  work and manage reviewer replacements without seeing or changing blind scores.
- As an admissions operator, I want to configure synthetic seat counts and
  income bands and let the locked lottery and admission/aid publication run
  automatically, without overriding any eligibility outcome, reviewer score, or
  draw.
- As an admissions operator, I want to correct factual/procedural errors and
  rerun the same locked rule rather than override an eligibility outcome.

### Reviewer

- As a reviewer, I want an assigned queue, deadlines, blind evidence, anchored
  dimensions, and evidence citations so I can make a constrained,
  domain-relevant per-dimension rubric score.
- As a reviewer, I want to save a draft, submit irreversible per-dimension
  scores, abstain for conflict/competence, or report a non-score blocker without
  seeing any peer score.

### Review Supervisor

- As a supervisor, I want only the blind slot-three cases assigned by the
  artifact-disagreement or narrative workflow so my scoring remains independent.
- As a supervisor, I want the same rubric and locked-submit controls as a
  reviewer without prior-score access or authority to override the averaged
  score.

The synthetic prototype uses configurable grade/service fixtures that are not
confirmed GT policy. The broader regression and future-persona libraries remain
in:

- `USER_STORIES.md`
- `USER_STORY_FEATURE_MAP.md`

Those libraries do not authorize additional functional MVP pages beyond the
four personas above.



## MVP Acceptance Checks

- Locked fictional Track A baseline results remain identical when Track B is enabled.
- A promising below-cutoff CogAT profile creates a Track B invitation, not immediate eligibility.
- Track B eligibility requires the CogAT gate and an averaged Snapshot review
  score at or above the configured cutoff.
- Track A eligibility proceeds to an automatic admission offer with configured
  aid and never enters the Snapshot or the lottery.
- The Snapshot is completable in 10–15 minutes without new child work.
- Lack of artifacts routes to the narrative fallback without penalty.
- Artifact disagreement beyond tolerance always triggers a blind supervisor
  review, and the three scores are averaged.
- Every narrative fallback receives three blind reviews whose scores are averaged.
- Invalid evidence becomes pending with a correction route.
- Prohibited fields cannot enter eligibility; income and household size affect
  only allocation banding, never the eligibility decision or its hash.
- Accommodation use and research refusal have no effect on routing or eligibility.
- Track B-eligible applicants are allocated by a household-size-adjusted
  income-banded lottery; the draw is locked and replayable, and eligibility is
  computed without any income input.
- A non-offered Track B applicant is distinguished from a not-eligible applicant
  and receives the next-cycle fee-waiver research invitation.
- Every synthetic decision — routing, review, allocation, and admission — can be
  replayed from retained inputs and versions.
- Applicant messages do not imply that a non-offer means “not gifted,” and no
  message claims a measured program effect.
- The family can traverse every page stage from profile selection through
  application, external CogAT handoff, routing result, Track B evidence when
  invited, eligibility, lottery allocation, and the admission/research decision
  without encountering a role-inappropriate surface.
- A valid CogAT result automatically runs routing and publishes the Track A,
  Track B invitation, or no-current-pathway notice; Track A eligibility never
  requests a Snapshot.
- Reviewer queues expose only assigned blind cases and deadlines; draft work is
  editable, final submission is locked, abstention creates replacement work,
  and blocker reporting creates pending work without a score.
- Supervisors receive only blind slot-three work, cannot see prior scores, and
  cannot override the averaged review score.
- Admissions can correct/rerun and configure seats/bands but cannot directly
  override eligibility, a reviewer score, or a lottery draw.
- In-app status/task/deadline notifications are present; email notifications are
  explicitly an extension after MVP.

### D-013 / Milestone A Onboarding Checks

- A guardian can reuse a profile for a cycle application; profile edits append
  successor versions, and submission binds the exact profile and private
  versions without rewriting prior submissions.
- Every tracked D-013 setup field round-trips through save, reload, review, and
  submit.
- Versioned directory selection and `other/not listed` entry both produce an
  exact school snapshot that survives later directory changes.
- Support, accommodation, discipline, and withdrawal branches enforce their
  conditional detail and explanation rules.
- Synthetic financial intake remains purpose-separated and private; it can be
  reloaded by its owner but cannot enter eligibility.
- Contracts and persistence reject the two general essays,
  current-school-enrollment/prior-school history, and W-2 or other proof
  documents.
- B11B server-only actions complete the local born-synthetic
  create/read/save/submit path without accepting identity or role from the
  request payload or exposing elevated credentials.
- Mutating profile, school-derived, support/disclosure, finance, referral, or
  signature fields changes zero eligibility inputs, results, or hashes; only
  current/requested grade and entry year may affect operational pathway
  availability.

## Workflow Status, Reason Codes, and Contract Summary

These values are the current Milestone A code contracts
(`packages/contracts/src/`), reproduced so this document's prose stages map to
concrete states. The code remains authoritative; if it diverges from this
summary, the code wins and this section is the bug.

> **Target divergence (approved, not yet implemented):** the expanded pipeline in
> the prose above — averaged reviewer scoring (replacing binary majority),
> income-banded lottery allocation, admission/aid outcomes, and the research
> handoff — is approved product direction whose contracts are **not yet built**.
> The tables below therefore still describe the shipped eligibility-only surface:
> the reviewer classification is still binary, and there are no allocation,
> admission, aid, or research states or reason codes in the code yet. Where a
> table row conflicts with the prose, the prose is the target and the code is the
> current reality; both are called out below.

### Application version state

An application progresses through an immutable, versioned lifecycle:
`draft` → `submitted` → `superseded`. Each save writes a new version with a
`sha256:` content hash and a `supersedes` pointer; a submitted version is locked
and can only be superseded through a traceable correction rerun, never rewritten
in place.

### Family-facing workflow status

The status projection exposes exactly one `workflowStatus` at a time, plus a
`phase` (`application`, `assessment`, `snapshot`, `review`, `decision`), a
`familyActionRequired` flag, an optional `nextActionCode` and `deadline`, an
optional `pendingReason`, and the fixed `claimBoundaryCode`
`ELIGIBILITY_NOT_ADMISSION`. The twelve statuses and the stage each maps to:

| Status | Stage / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `application_draft` | Stage 1 — application being completed/saved |
| `awaiting_assessment` | Stage 1→2 — submitted, external CogAT pending |
| `assessment_needs_correction` | Stage 2 — CogAT missing/invalid, pending correction |
| `track_a_eligible` | Stage 3 — Track A eligible (no Snapshot requested) |
| `track_b_snapshot_required` | Stage 3 — Track B Snapshot invited |
| `no_current_pathway` | Stage 3 — below cutoff and not invited |
| `snapshot_under_review` | Stage 4→5 — Snapshot submitted, blind review in progress |
| `review_pending_family_action` | Stage 5 — paused; family owes an action |
| `review_pending_internal_action` | Stage 5 — paused; admissions/access owes an action |
| `track_b_eligible` | Stage 6 — final: qualifies |
| `track_b_does_not_currently_qualify` | Stage 6 — final: does not currently qualify |
| `policy_configuration_pending` | Any — blocked on an unresolved configuration input |

### Pending work

A pause never becomes a negative vote. Pending work carries a `pendingReason`
(`pending_assessment_correction`, `pending_evidence_correction`,
`pending_additional_blind_review`, `pending_accessibility_route`,
`pending_policy_configuration`), an owner role (`family`, `admissions`,
`access_steward`, `decision_service`), a route code, a deadline, and a state of
`open`, `escalated`, or `resolved`.

### Review states and outcomes

Snapshot route is `artifact` or `narrative`. Reviewer/supervisor slots are 1 and
2 (`reviewer`) and 3 (`supervisor`); the rubric is version `RB-SYN-01` with six
dimension codes: `DE` (Domain Expertise), `LR` (Learning rate), `TA` (Transfer
or abstraction), `IN` (Independence), `RE` (Recurrence), and `SP` (Evidence
specificity). A reviewer classification is `qualifies` or
`does_not_currently_qualify`; drafts are editable, final submission is locked,
and peer votes are never exposed.

*Target:* per the prose above, the shipped binary classification is replaced by
per-dimension numeric rubric scores that are averaged into a Track B review score
and compared to a configured cutoff; the `qualifies` / `does_not_currently_qualify`
result then derives from that averaged score rather than a majority vote.

### Decision reason codes

Every routing and eligibility decision carries an ordered, non-empty list of
reason codes (`packages/contracts/src/reason-codes.ts`), a result hash, and a
policy-bundle id. The thirteen codes:

| Reason code | Applies to |
| --- | --- |
| `TA_MET_CONFIGURED_BOUNDARY` | Track A eligible |
| `TA_BELOW_CONFIGURED_BOUNDARY` | Below the Track A cutoff |
| `TB_COMPOSITE_BAND` | Track B invited via promising composite band |
| `TB_BATTERY_PROFILE` | Track B invited via strong battery profile |
| `TB_OUTSIDE_CONFIGURED_RULE` | Not invited to Track B |
| `ASSESSMENT_MISSING_OR_INVALID` | CogAT pending correction |
| `SNAPSHOT_REQUIRED` | Snapshot evidence requested |
| `REVIEW_MAJORITY_QUALIFIES` | Track B eligible by reviewer majority |
| `REVIEW_MAJORITY_DOES_NOT_CURRENTLY_QUALIFY` | Track B does not currently qualify |
| `EVIDENCE_NEEDS_CORRECTION` | Evidence routed to pending correction |
| `ADDITIONAL_BLIND_REVIEW_REQUIRED` | Artifact disagreement adds slot three |
| `ACCESSIBILITY_ROUTE_REQUIRED` | Accessible alternative / pending route |
| `POLICY_CONFIGURATION_PENDING` | Blocked on an unresolved configuration input |

Decision outcomes are enumerated per kind: Track A (`eligible`, `not_eligible`,
`pending`), Track B invitation (`invited`, `not_invited`, `not_applicable`,
`pending`), and Track B eligibility (`qualifies`, `does_not_currently_qualify`,
`pending`).

*Target additions (not yet in the code):* the expanded pipeline introduces
workflow states and decision kinds beyond the shipped enum above — an admission
offer for Track A eligibility, an income-banded lottery allocation for Track B
eligibility (`offered` / `not_offered`), an aid-allotment outcome, and a
research-invitation state for non-offered Track B applicants. The two
`REVIEW_MAJORITY_*` reason codes are also superseded by averaged-score
equivalents. These are approved target behavior; the shipped
`claimBoundaryCode` `ELIGIBILITY_NOT_ADMISSION` remains correct for the
eligibility-phase projection, since a seat offer is still a separate downstream
allocation step.

### Concurrency, idempotency, and error contract

Every mutating call carries an `idempotencyKey`, an `expectedVersion` for
optimistic concurrency, and a `correlationId`. This is the mechanism behind the
save/resume and two-session save/submit guarantees noted in the status block at
the top of this document: a stale write fails with `STALE_VERSION`, a replayed
key with `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`, and a second submit with `SUBMISSION_LOCKED`.
The error envelope returns a machine `code`, a `retryable` flag, the
`correlationId`, the `currentState`, and field-level errors. The seventeen error
codes (`packages/contracts/src/errors.ts`) are `VALIDATION_FAILED`,
`AUTH_REQUIRED`, `ROLE_FORBIDDEN`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `STALE_VERSION`,
`INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION`, `SUBMISSION_LOCKED`, `ASSIGNMENT_CONFLICT`,
`NOT_INVITED`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`, `INPUT_HASH_MISMATCH`,
`POLICY_HASH_MISMATCH`, `CODE_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE`, `FIXTURE_NOT_ALLOWLISTED`,
`NON_SYNTHETIC_INPUT`, `FEATURE_DISABLED`, and `SERIALIZATION_RETRY_EXHAUSTED`.

## Non-Functional Requirements and Notifications

These are the dev-actionable baselines for the synthetic prototype. Items marked
proposed are engineering baselines, not ratified decisions; live-use targets
remain blocked by `B-06` and E-024–E-027 and are not claimed here.

- **Accessibility** — applicant-facing surfaces target WCAG 2.2 AA (proposed
  baseline, not yet a ratified decision) with an accessible alternative for
  every evidence route. Formal conformance and any accessible-route equivalence
  claim remain subject to `B-06`/E-024–E-027.
- **Internationalization** — applicant-facing language and translated routes are
  target behavior; the live language set and translation mechanism remain
  configurable under E-065/E-024–E-027 and are not finalized.
- **Data minimization and retention** — the prototype stores only born-synthetic
  values; live retention/deletion windows for support, discipline, and finance
  context remain open under E-064/E-065 and `B-06`.
- **Platform/runtime** — the current implementation is a local, single-node
  Supabase/PostgreSQL stack; performance budgets, availability targets, and a
  supported-browser matrix are Milestone B concerns and are not specified for
  the synthetic prototype.
- **Notifications** — the MVP delivers in-app task, status, and deadline
  notifications derived from the workflow status projection and pending-item
  owner/deadline fields; Milestone A adds no separate notification store or
  trigger language. Synthetic email notifications are an explicit post-MVP
  extension.

## Target Tech Stack (Milestone B)

- **Next.js**
  - Provides the Family Portal, Admissions Dashboard, Reviewer Workspace, and
    blind Supervisor Workspace. Configuration/audit remains a future or
    non-functional demonstration surface, not a fifth functional MVP persona.
  - Targets container deployment on **Amazon ECS Fargate**, fronted by **Amazon CloudFront + ALB**.
- **AWS with PostgreSQL (Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, PostgreSQL-compatible)**
  - The target PostgreSQL deployment stores synthetic applications, CogAT profiles, Snapshot metadata, reviewer classifications, workflow states, and audit events. Row-level security, `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs, immutable versioning, hash-chained audit, and deterministic replay are retained from the PostgreSQL design.
  - The target **Amazon Cognito** binding provides authentication; the JWT carries an admin-controlled `custom:user_role` claim, and the application sets request-scoped PostgreSQL session settings that RLS policies read.
  - Target services include private **Amazon S3** object storage, **RDS Proxy**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, and IAM database authentication, with no row-level-security-bypassing credential in the application runtime.
- **High-level product modules**
  - Base application (in-house, low-friction; replaces the Finalsite form)
  - CogAT routing
  - Track B Snapshot
  - Independent review and adjudication (averaged rubric scoring)
  - Income-banded lottery allocation and admission/aid outcomes
  - Research-study invitation and MAP data handoff
  - Decision explanation, correction, and re-entry (substantive rubric appeal deferred beyond MVP)
  - Configuration and audit

D-012 approves this Milestone B platform target but does not establish that an
AWS account, resources, DNS, or endpoint currently exists. The current
Milestone A implementation remains local and born-synthetic; live child data
and production/public deployment are unauthorized. See
`docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` and E-057/E-058.
