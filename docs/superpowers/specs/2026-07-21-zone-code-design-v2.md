# Code Zone — Deepened Design **v2** (LAAS-level): Discovery World + Domain Content App

**Date:** 2026-07-21 · **Owner:** David · **Lane:** 3 (parallel zone loop) · **Supersedes:** the child-facing
depth of [`2026-07-21-zone-code-design.md`](./2026-07-21-zone-code-design.md) (v1). The v1 probe catalog,
work-mode mapping, and core binding are **kept and extended**; the *single conflated activity* is **split
into two layers** and both are taken to reference-frame depth.

**Implements:** `ZonePlugin` from [`2026-07-21-interest-lab-world-design.md`](./2026-07-21-interest-lab-world-design.md) §4,
against the **frozen** lane-0 contract in [`2026-07-21-interest-lab-core-spec.md`](./2026-07-21-interest-lab-core-spec.md)
(`ZonePlugin`/`RoomProps`/`ActivityEvent` §3).

**Grounded in:** `docs/research/stylizedWorldAssetPipeline.md` (CC0 + art direction + Chromebook budgets),
`docs/research/interest-lab-world-precedents.md` (intrinsic integration; explorable explanations; the return
signal; the Dead-Space diegesis caution), `docs/research/passionBrainlift.md` (manufacture-and-prune; never
label; chase deep absorption; **don't gamify the signal**), `gt100k-factory/docs/RESEARCH-visual-ux-qa-harness.md`
(the `window.__qa` gate, raycast round-trip, VLM rubric), and the **LAAS depth method**
([`Braffolk/fable5-world-demo` · `PROJECT_LAAS_v2.md`](https://github.com/Braffolk/fable5-world-demo/blob/main/PROJECT_LAAS_v2.md)):
*a concrete visual bar with reference frames, hard floors that define the bar, an explicit banned-outcomes
list, a mandatory reference-delta loop, and a reference-anchored self-score — judged against images, not
against "pretty good for a browser."*

Reference model for the content app: **[Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org)** interactive lessons and the
sibling audio app **[blazing-audio-alpha.web.app](https://blazing-audio-alpha.web.app/)** ("*Learn how audio
really works, one hands-on lesson at a time*").

This spec owns only `passion/packages/interest-zone-code/`. The single shared-root touch is registering the
plugin in the app's zone registry.

## 0. The architecture pivot (why v2 exists)

v1 put the *entire* learning experience — arrange command tiles, run the bot, watch it fail, fix it —
**inside the bounded 3D room**. That conflates two jobs that want opposite designs:

- **Discovery** wants *atmosphere, invitation, and a legible interest signal* — a beautiful cozy place you
  wander into, that says "computation lives here," and quietly records that you approached, dwelled, and
  came back. It must be gorgeous and it must be **fast on a Chromebook**, so it must stay small.
- **Deep learning** wants *hands-on interactive density, a concept ladder, immediate visual results, and
  productive failure* — a Brilliant-style experience where **manipulating the thing is the explanation**.
  Cramming that into a raycast-driven 3D room fights legibility, accessibility, and the frame budget.

**v2 splits them into two layers with one seam:**

```
┌──────────────────────────── THE DISCOVERY WORLD (Part A) ─────────────────────────────┐
│  2D Curiosity Map building  ──enter──▶  bounded 3D "Code Lab" workshop (cozy, beautiful)│
│  • exploration + atmosphere + interest signal (approach / dwell / voluntary return)     │
│  • ONE obvious verb: step up to the glowing BUILD BENCH                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                            │  THE SEAM (Part C): open the bench
                                            ▼

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The room is not the container; it is the doorway.** The deep learning is a Brilliant-style module opened
*from* the doorway. Both layers feed one signal. Everything below designs both to the LAAS bar.

### 0.1 The depth contract (LAAS, adapted to a cozy bounded product)

We are **not** chasing UE5 open-world fidelity — the constraint is a school Chromebook and a *cozy* mood
(A Short Hike / Alba / Cozy Grove / Animal Crossing), not an alpine ravine. But we adopt the **LAAS method
verbatim**:

1. **A concrete visual bar with reference frames.** Assemble `/reference` (real screenshots from the named
   touchstones). Every phase is judged **side-by-side against those frames**, not against "good for a
   browser." Building to a lower bar because it is comfortable is a **failed task**.
2. **Reference-delta loop (mandatory, every phase).** Render the closest matching shot, place it beside the
   reference, write `DELTA.md`: the **ten most visually significant differences, ranked by impact**. Fix the
   top three. Re-render. Only then does the phase close.
3. **Hard floors** (§A6, §B9): numbers that define the bar. Under-dressing is a failure mode, exactly like
   LAAS's "under-rendering is a failure mode."
4. **Banned outcomes — instant fail** (§A9, §B9, §D2).
5. **Reference-anchored self-score** (§A10, §B11): per row, `10 = passes a one-second glance against the
   reference · 7 = clearly synthetic but same class · 4 = decent hobby demo · 2 = 2010 asset-flip`. Score
   after every phase; write "what raises this by 2 points"; implement the two cheapest before proceeding.
6. **Final acceptance = a two-frame + one-flow test** (§D5).

**The six cozy-room pillars (resolve any ambiguity in favor of the pillar):**

| # | Pillar | The rule (LAAS-style, cozy-adapted) |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Cozy beats impressive** | "I want to be in this room" wins over technical flex. Target a late-afternoon sunbeam in a maker's nook. A cold, empty, "clean" room is a fail even at 60fps. |
| **B** | **Light transport, cozy-grade** | **No black shadows, ever.** Warm key (window sun) + cool sky fill; shadowed wood/brass reads warm-brown, never desaturated gray. *Sample any shadowed pixel — if it's flat gray, lighting has failed.* |
| **C** | **Nothing is bare / everything is hand-made** | Every surface class carries a maker's marks: tools, shavings, blueprints, half-built contraptions, plants, mugs, jars, string-lights. The room reads as a place where someone has been *building things for years*. |
| **D** | **One obvious verb** | The room teaches by affordance (World 1-1) that you *step up to the bench*. Exactly one primary interactive; everything else is beautiful, legible atmosphere. No tutorial wall. |
| **E** | **Art direction is enforced** | One locked palette (the engine `PALETTE` + the computation hue), one shading model, one HDRI, a warm/cool split, controlled value structure (dark frame · lit bench subject · soft background). Showcase views are *composed*, not found. |
| **F** | **The room breathes** | Dust motes in the sunbeam, one slow-turning gear, a swaying plant, the bench glow pulsing, a wind-up toy idling. A frozen frame feels one second from motion. |

### 0.2 Shared foundations (fiction · palette · engine types · domain binding)

**Fiction (one warm workshop, two depths).** The **Code Lab** is a sunlit inventor's workshop — a cozy
maker's nook where someone builds little wind-up automata and logic contraptions. You wander in (the 3D
room), you're drawn to the **Build Bench** glowing at the window, you *step up to it* — and the bench opens
into **the Build Bench app** (the content app) where you actually build, run, and debug little programs that
bring the workshop's creations to life. Your finished creations come back to live on **the Shelf** in the
room.

**Palette lock (from `interest-lab-view/src/art.ts`, do not invent new hues).**
`PALETTE.spark #FF9E5E` (warm invitation / the bench glow), `PALETTE.beacon #FFD166` (success / focal
warmth), `PALETTE.tide #5EC8D8` (cool accent / cyan practical light), `PALETTE.sprout #7BD88F` (plant life /
"go"), `PALETTE.night #181026` / `nightSunk #120B1E` (shadow frame). The **computation domain hue** comes
from `resolveDomainHue(domainOrder, "computation")` / `HUE_RAMP` (the marker + building tint). Typography
from `TYPOGRAPHY` (Fredoka display · Iowan reading · Inter body). Motion from `resolveMotion(...)` tokens
(`MOTION`/`EASINGS`), reduced-motion honored.

**Engine types (frozen, from the repo — reference, do not redefine):** `Probe`/`ProbeFamily`/`Domain`,
`WorkMode`/`WORK_MODES` (nine verbs), `EngagementEvent`/`EventType`/`EVENT_TYPES`, `InterventionContext`,
`SignalSummary` (`@gt100k/interest-lab`); `ActivityEvent`/`ActivityKind`, `RoomProps`, `ZonePlugin`
(frozen lane-0 contract). **v2 emits the frozen `ActivityEvent` (`kind`) — not raw `EngagementEvent`** — and
lets the core's `toEngagementEvents` bridge to the six families (this corrects v1 §11, which emitted
`EngagementEvent` directly and predates the frozen contract).

**Domain binding (decision).** This zone declares `domain: "computation"` (per the world design and this
task's signal `{domain:"computation", workMode}`). `Domain` is an open `string`; `createZoneRegistry`
only requires `probes[].domain === plugin.domain`. **Reconciliation note for lane 0:** the core-spec stub
vocabulary used `symbols_math` for Code; the real zone uses `computation`. Whichever string the *registered
catalog* adopts, all three zones must share the **same** work-mode column strings (`build`/`debug`/
`investigate`/`compose`) or the cross-domain column signal breaks. The domain string is a one-line registry
decision; the design here is invariant to it.

# PART A — THE DISCOVERY WORLD (the cozy 3D Code Lab + 2D building)

## A1. The visual bar — reference frames (obsess over the contents)

Assemble `passion/packages/interest-zone-code/reference/` with real screenshots for each frame below, from
the named touchstones. **Each phase renders the closest shot and runs the delta loop against these.**

### RF-W1 — "The sunlit maker's nook" (hero establishing shot of the 3D room)
*Touchstones:* A Short Hike interiors, Cozy Grove tents, Alba's cottages, Animal Crossing rooms, Luma
Island workshops, "cozy inventor workshop lowpoly" (ArtStation/itch).
**What the frame must contain:** a 3/4 view into a small wooden workshop; a **big window** on the left
spilling a warm afternoon **sunbeam** with visible **dust motes**; a central **workbench** carrying a
**half-built wind-up automaton**, scattered tools, blueprints, and a glowing focal object; a **pegboard**
of hand tools behind; a **shelf** of little finished creations on the right; **plants** (a trailing vine,
a potted sprout); **string-lights** or a warm bench lamp; a mug, jars of gears/screws, curled blueprint
paper, wood shavings on the floor. Warm honey wood + brass, cool cyan/violet in the shadows. The eye lands
on the glowing bench within one second.
**FAIL if the frame looks like:** an empty room with one table and a button; bare untextured walls; a cold
gray box; a lobby.

### RF-W2 — "The bench, ready" (the primary affordance, close)
*Touchstones:* the glowing anvil/portal in cozy games; Monument Valley's warm focal geometry; a lit forge.
**What the frame must contain:** the **Build Bench** as the single brightest warm focal point — a workbench
with a **hovering, gently-pulsing blueprint/hologram of a tiny program** (icon-blocks floating a few cm
above the bench), a chunky **wind-up "GO" key** or lever, `spark #FF9E5E` rim-glow, warm bloom, and a
clearly-implied "step up here" affordance (a worn spot, an inviting stool, an arrow of light). It reads as
*the one thing to do* without any text label.
**FAIL if the frame looks like:** a flat button floating in 3D; a generic "Enter" sign; nothing obviously
primary; two competing focal points.

### RF-W3 — "The Code Lab on the map" (the 2D building tile)
*Touchstones:* Animal Crossing map icons, A Short Hike map, cozy isometric building tiles, the existing
Curiosity-Map buildings.
**What the frame must contain:** a small, warm, hand-drawn-feeling **workshop building** with a gear-sprout
sign, tinted to the computation hue, sitting in its island slot; a soft **shelf-glow** cue *iff* the child
has kept/unfinished creations (the return cue); a clear one-verb label ("Step inside"); a legible
return-state cue (new / you've been here / you came back). Focusable, keyboard-navigable, never
`aria-hidden`.
**FAIL if the frame looks like:** a flat colored rectangle; an unreadable icon; no return cue; indistinct
from other buildings.

> **The rule (LAAS §top):** you will not fully reach these frames on a Chromebook — the task is to *close as
> much of the gap as the budget allows and know precisely how far you got*. A result that reads as a 2010
> asset-flip — bare surfaces, gray shadows, cloned props, a button over a backdrop — is a **failed task**,
> no matter how clean the code.

## A2. The 2D map building — exact contents & states

Consumes `MapBuildingView` (label / glyph / enterVerb / cell / art). Rendered by the core `<CuriosityMap>`
as a **real focusable button** (never `aria-hidden`).

| Field | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | "Code Lab" | |
| `glyph` | `gear-sprout` | a cog with a leaf — "logic that grows"; decorative only |
| `enterVerb` | "Step inside" | World-1-1 single verb |
| `art.hue` | `resolveDomainHue(order,"computation")` | else derived from catalog order |
| `sprite` | `workshop` | cozy workshop/greenhouse silhouette |
| `ambientCue` | `shelf-glow` | soft `spark` glow **iff** saved/unfinished creations exist |

**States (all cozy, none coercive):** `new` (fresh, faint sparkle) · `explored` (you've been here; sparkle
gone) · `voluntary-return` (warm `welcome-back` glow, **no points**) · `prompted-return` (recedes to
`PALETTE.prompted`, tagged, ≠ signal). `unfinished > 0` shows a single gentle "your half-built thing is
still here" glow — **never a badge, counter, or countdown**.

## A3. The 3D room — exact contents (the obsessive enumeration)

Fixed 3/4 camera (`fov 35–40`), orbit **disabled/clamped**; contents swap inside the shared persistent
`<Canvas>` on enter/exit (never remount). The room is **one composed diorama**, not a walkable level. Every
item below is a required occupant (Pillar C).

**Zone 1 — The window & light source (left).** A mullioned **window**; a warm **sunbeam** volume (god-ray
cone) landing on the bench; **dust motes** drifting in it (`<Sparkles>`); a **windowsill** with 2–3 potted
sprouts and a small watering can; a **trailing vine** framing the top-left.

**Zone 2 — The Build Bench (center, the hero / primary affordance).** A solid **workbench**; on it: a
**half-built wind-up automaton** ("Pip" mid-assembly — the content app's protagonist, foreshadowed), an
open **blueprint** with faint icon-blocks, a **jar of gears**, a **brass "GO" wind-up key/lever**, a small
**vise**, wood shavings. Floating a few cm above the bench: the **program hologram** — 3–5 translucent
icon-blocks gently bobbing (`<Float>`) with a `spark` rim-glow and soft bloom. **This is the one primary
interactive** (`go-bench`): approaching/activating it opens the content app.

**Zone 3 — The pegboard & tool wall (back).** A **pegboard** with hand tools (screwdrivers, pliers,
calipers, a soldering iron), each on its silhouette outline; pinned notes and a small **chalkboard** with a
hand-drawn **flow diagram** (a tiny start→arrow→loop→goal sketch — diegetic foreshadowing of the concepts).

**Zone 4 — The Shelf (right, the memory / return cue).** A wooden **shelf** with slots. Each **kept
creation** appears as a tiny finished automaton or a labeled ribbon ("★ solved in N blocks"); **empty slots
are visible** (room to make more). The shelf **glows softly** iff kept/unfinished work exists. This is the
diegetic form of `unfinished`/artifacts — the room saying "your things are still here."

**Zone 5 — The floor & cozy dressing.** A **rug**; a **stool** worn where you'd stand at the bench (the
"step up here" affordance); a **crate** of spare parts; a **mug** on a side table; a stack of **books**; a
**string-light** garland; scattered **wood shavings** and a curled blueprint on the floor. A **desk lamp**
(warm practical) and a small **cyan monitor/oscilloscope glow** (cool practical) for the warm/cool split.

**Overworld idle (activeZoneId === null).** Before entering, the shared canvas shows a calm ambient
backdrop (soft interior bokeh or the island exterior); no dead objects.

## A4. Materials, lighting, atmosphere, motion (reference-frame-level)

**One shading model** — **flat toon/PBR** with baked AO on the atlas (per pipeline §4.4). No `MeshBasic`.
**Macro–meso–micro (Pillar C, LAAS §4):** every hero surface shows ≥3 detail bands — base color, a
wear/AO/grain band (edge wear on the bench, grain in the wood, patina on brass), and a highlight/emissive
or rim. **Single-flat-color hero surfaces are banned.** **Per-instance variation:** props that repeat
(jars, gears, books, pots) get hue/value/rotation jitter and a fraction show wear — no cloned grids.

**Lighting (Pillar B, cozy no-black-shadows law).** One warm **key** `directionalLight` (the window sun,
the only shadow-caster) + a low cool **hemisphere/sky fill** so shadows read warm-brown, never gray. **≥2
diegetic practicals:** the warm bench lamp and the cool cyan monitor/oscilloscope glow (+ optional
string-lights). One self-hosted **CC0 warm-interior HDRI** (Poly Haven, 1–2K) via `<Environment>` for
consistent ambient + brass reflections; `<Lightformer>` rects for cheap glints on metal.

**Shadows (bake/freeze, Pillar B).** `<AccumulativeShadows>` + `<RandomizedLight>` for the settled soft
hero shadow under the bench (zero cost once settled) or `<ContactShadows frames={1}>` under bench/shelf/
stool; `<BakeShadows>` elsewhere. **No per-frame shadow maps.**

**Atmosphere (Pillar A/F).** Palette-matched soft **fog** for depth (never to hide an empty room); the
**sunbeam** volume; **dust motes** (`<Sparkles>`); optional faint `<Cloud>` outside the window.

**Motion (Pillar F, ≥4 independent idle motions).** (1) dust motes drift; (2) one **slow-turning gear** on
the bench; (3) a **plant sway** / `<Float>` on a hanging pot; (4) the **bench hologram** bobs + glow
**pulses** (`spark`); (+) the half-built automaton does a tiny wind-up twitch every few seconds. All via
`resolveMotion`; **reduced-motion → instant/settled** (no essential motion; the bench glow becomes a static
highlight).

**Post (budgeted).** `EffectComposer` → `Bloom(mipmapBlur, luminanceThreshold ~1.0)` (bench glow +
practicals) + `Vignette` + `ToneMapping(ACES)`, renderer `NoToneMapping`. SMAA (not MSAA).

**Camera & composition (Pillar E).** Fixed composed 3/4 shot obeying dark-frame (foreground crate/vine) ·
lit-subject (the bench) · soft-background (pegboard in gentle fog). A gentle ease-in on enter; no orbit.

## A5. Hard floors (the numbers that define the bar)

Under-dressing is a failure mode (LAAS "under-rendering is a failure"). At `room-3d`:

| Dimension | Floor |
|---|---|
| **Distinct dressing occupants** visible in the hero framing | **≥ 40** hand-made/maker objects (tools, gears, jars, blueprints, plants, mugs, books, wind-up parts, shavings, string-lights…) |
| **Occupied surface classes** (Pillar C) | window sill · bench top · pegboard · shelf · floor · side table — **each carries ≥ 3 objects**; none bare |
| **Material bands per hero surface** | **≥ 3** (base + wear/AO + highlight/emissive) |
| **Light sources** | **≥ 1** warm key (shadow-caster) + **≥ 1** cool fill + **≥ 2** diegetic practicals |
| **No-black-shadows law** | sampled shadowed-wood/brass pixels show warm chroma; **0** desaturated-gray shadow samples |
| **Independent idle motions** | **≥ 4** running at rest |
| **Primary affordance** | exactly **1** (`go-bench`), the brightest warm focal point, pulsing, wordlessly "step up" |
| **Shelf** | ≥ 1 slot per kept artifact + **visible empty slots**; glows iff kept/unfinished work exists |
| **Draw calls** | **< 50** (hard: < 100) — instanced repeats, shared atlas/material, one skinned mesh max |
| **Triangles** | ≤ ~150k in the room |
| **dpr / frameloop** | `dpr ≤ 1.5` · `frameloop="demand"` (render on enter / motion tick / bench activate) |

## A6. Teach-by-affordance — moment-to-moment in the room (zero tutorial)

On first entry the camera eases into the nook. With **no modal, no text**: the **bench hologram bobs and
its glow pulses once** (→ *look here*); the **sunbeam** points the eye at the bench; the **worn stool**
implies *stand here*. The child moves to the bench (click/tap the `go-bench`, or keyboard-focus + Enter, or
walk a clamped avatar to it) → a warm chime + a "blueprint unrolls" transition → the **content app opens**.
That is the room's entire job: be beautiful, say "building happens here," and hand off. On later visits the
**Shelf glow** (if any) is the single gentle "your things are still here" cue — never a countdown.

## A7. CC0 asset pipeline + Chromebook budget + tiers

**Assets (all CC0 — commercial-safe, no attribution):**

| Element | Source (CC0) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workshop shell, bench, shelf, pegboard, crates, furniture | Kenney (Furniture/Building kits) + KayKit modular | merged/instanced; one gradient atlas |
| Tools, gears, jars, mugs, books, lamps, props | Kenney + Quaternius + Poly Pizza (verify per-model CC0) | instanced repeats w/ per-instance jitter |
| Plants / vines / sprouts | Quaternius nature | `<Float>` on one hanging pot |
| Half-built "Pip" automaton (foreshadow) | Quaternius/KayKit robot + CC0 anim set | the lone skinned mesh; idle twitch anim |
| Warm-interior HDRI | Poly Haven (1–2K, self-hosted) | `<Environment>` IBL |
| Bench hologram icon-blocks | authored flat SVG/atlas | shared with the content app's block icons |

**Pipeline (`stylizedWorldAssetPipeline.md` §7):** `gltf-transform optimize --compress meshopt
--texture-compress ktx2` → `gltfjsx --transform --types` → `useGLTF.preload`. One palette + one shading
model + fog (§A4). **Perf:** `dpr={[1,1.5]}`, `antialias:false`+SMAA, `frameloop="demand"`,
`<PerformanceMonitor>`+`<AdaptiveDpr>`.

**Tiers / degrade (frozen `RoomProps.tier`; legacy `RenderTier` = `quest-world-3d | quest-world-3d-lite |
board-2d`):** `room-3d` (full) → drop `<Sparkles>` → drop `Bloom` → **`room-3d-lite`** (flat lights, no
post, fewer motes) → **world `ActivityDOM`** (the described-room a11y floor, §A8). **The content app is
independent of this ladder** — it is 2D-first and runs on every device (see Part B), so a child who can't
run any 3D still reaches the *full* deep learning.

## A8. World-layer accessibility — `ActivityDOM` (a peer doorway, not a lesser menu)

The world layer's `ActivityDOM` is a **described room** that preserves the *act of walking up to build* and
the *return cue* (Surveyor: don't railroad; AGI/MS tags: focus one item at a time, narrate name/role/state).
It is **not** the block editor (that lives in the content app, which is already keyboard/SR-first):

- A labeled region: *"Code Lab — a maker's workshop. On the bench: a half-built wind-up robot and a glowing
  blueprint."*
- One primary button: **"Step up to the Build Bench"** (opens the content app — the same seam).
- A **Shelf list**: *"Your creations: 'Pip's first walk' (kept), 1 unfinished."* — the child still **chooses
  what to reopen**.
- Parity by construction: identical `probeId` / `workMode` / `returnState` / `tone` per `plainZoneEquals`;
  reduced-motion → instant framing.

## A9. Banned outcomes — instant fail (the room)

- Canvas is `aria-hidden` / `role=presentation` with **no** DOM alternative (the exact prior shipped bug).
- **The room is a lobby:** a flat backdrop with a button floating over it; bare surfaces; < 40 occupants;
  any bare hero surface class.
- **Dead primary affordance:** `go-bench` doesn't open the content app / doesn't change `stateHash()`.
- **Black or gray-ambient shadows;** flat-lit look; `MeshBasicMaterial` in the world.
- **Cloned props** (shared mesh varied only by rotation/scale); a grid of identical items; uniform tint with
  no per-instance jitter.
- **Fog to hide an empty room;** skybox-only background; a single bare wall behind the bench.
- **The room becomes the deep learning container** (v1 regression) — it tries to *be* the puzzle instead of
  handing off to the content app.
- **A quiz/modal wall or tutorial-text dump on entry.**
- **Any streak / point / FOMO / countdown** anywhere in the room; a badge on `unfinished`.
- **> 50 draw calls** at `room-3d`; frame drops below the tier floor on a real Chromebook under sustained
  load.

## A10. Self-score rubric (anchored to RF-W1/W2/W3) + delta loop

Score after every phase (`10 = passes a one-second glance vs the reference · 7 = clearly synthetic but same
class · 4 = decent hobby demo · 2 = 2010 asset-flip`). For each row write "what raises this by 2 points";
implement the **two cheapest** before proceeding.

Rows: **cozy mood & invitation · light transport (no-black-shadows) · dressing density & hand-made feel ·
material bands · palette cohesion · the bench reads as THE verb in <1s · motion/liveliness · composition
(dark-frame/lit-subject/soft-bg) · the 2D building tile (RF-W3) · Chromebook perf.**

**Delta loop (mandatory):** render the closest shot to RF-W1, RF-W2, RF-W3 → side-by-side → `DELTA.md`
top-10 ranked → fix top-3 → re-render → close phase.

---

# PART B — THE DOMAIN CONTENT APP (Brilliant-style computation)

## B1. The bet + the reference model

> **A hands-on workbench where you snap big command blocks together, press GO, and watch a little world do
> exactly what you told it — and by *making it work*, you discover sequence, loops, conditionals, variables,
> and functions for yourself. The arranging-of-logic is the whole game; the concept is the only way to win;
> the result is immediate and delightful.**

**There is no quiz, no multiple-choice, no "type this exact code," no "what does this print?" trivia, no
prose lecture with a widget bolted on.** The mechanic **is** the learning act (Habgood & Ainsworth intrinsic
integration; Bret Victor / Nicky Case *explorable explanations* — *manipulating the simulation is the
explanation*). This is the Brilliant model and the `blazing-audio` sibling model: **learn how it really
works, one hands-on lesson at a time**, where each lesson is a live thing you manipulate, not a page you

**Reference model, concretely:** Brilliant.org lessons — a single big manipulable widget centered in
generous whitespace; you drag/tap/arrange; the result updates *instantly*; a tiny bit of framing text, then
you *do*; short satisfying steps; safe failure; a clear "you made it work." We build the *coding* version
of that.

## B2. The visual bar — reference frames for the content app

Assemble `reference/content-app/` from these. Obsess over the contents.

### RF-C1 — "A Brilliant lesson, mid-manipulation" (the core screen)
*Touchstones:* Brilliant.org interactive lessons; blazing-audio lessons; Scratch/Blockly but *calmer and
warmer*; a cozy puzzle app (A Monster's Expedition, Untangle).
**What the frame must contain:** generous warm whitespace; a **live world panel** (a small grid garden with
"Pip" the wind-up bot on it, a glowing goal); a **program strip** of 3–6 **big chunky tactile blocks**
(icon-first, color-coded, clearly draggable, casting a soft shadow); **one unmistakable primary action** — a
big `sprout`-green **GO** wind-up key; the **currently-running block lit** with the bot mid-hop; minimal
text (one short line of framing). It looks *touchable* and *alive*, not like a form.
**FAIL if the frame looks like:** a code editor with a text field; a multiple-choice question; a wall of
instructions; tiny fiddly widgets; a spreadsheet; anything that reads as "a test."

### RF-C2 — "The aha" (immediate visual result / success)
*What the frame must contain:* the bot reaching the goal; the goal **blooming** (seed-battery lights, a warm
`beacon` chime, a few `<Sparkles>`); a **"★ solved in N blocks"** ribbon settling; the program strip still
showing exactly what the child built (cause↔effect legible). Joyful, brief, not a fireworks tax.
*FAIL:* a bare "Correct!" banner; a modal that hides the world; a score/XP pop; a "next" button that erases
what they made.

### RF-C3 — "The Tinker Studio" (open sandbox / compose)
*What the frame must contain:* a blank-ish world + the **full block palette** + a "name your creation" field
(icon-first); the child setting *their own* goal ("make Pip draw a star"); a **Save**/**Share** affordance;
the sense of a toy, not a task.
*FAIL:* the sandbox is just an empty level with a hidden "right answer"; no way to save/name/share; it feels
like more homework.

## B3. The mechanic — block/visual programming + immediate visual results

**The substrate (one extensible engine, many lessons — this is what makes it buildable *and* deep).**

- **The world panel** — a small grid diorama (2D top-down or light 2.5D canvas) with an **agent** (Pip, the
  wind-up bot), a **goal** (a seed-battery / lightbulb-flower that blooms), **walls/gates/keys/switches**,
  and later **sensors** and **collectibles**. Rendered on a light `<canvas>` (or SVG) — **not** the heavy
  3D room; runs on any Chromebook.
- **The program surface** — big **command blocks** you snap into a sequence (a rail) or a small 2D canvas.
  **Icon-first**, color-coded by type, tactile (snap with a click + bounce; never a text field). Blocks:
  `Step`, `Turn L/R`, `Repeat N {…}`, `If <sensor> {…} else {…}`, `Grab`, `Use`, `Set <var>`, `Change <var>`,
  `Define <name> {…}` / call, `When <event> {…}`.
- **Run** — the big `sprout` **GO** key. On press, blocks **highlight one at a time** as the agent executes
  them; **one grid cell per `Step` with a hop**, a spin per `Turn`. The **currently-running block lights up**
  so cause↔effect is unmistakable.
- **Immediate visual result — the "aha" is *prediction confirmed*.** "If I drop a `Turn` *here*…" → GO → Pip
  does exactly that → the goal blooms. Each cycle is **seconds** long and **fully visible**.
- **Safe failure (never punished).** Pip bumps a wall (soft *boing*, rubs its head — **no buzzer, no red
  WRONG**) or stops short. A faint **ghost trail** shows where it went vs. the goal; the **block where it
  went wrong softly pulses**; the program is left **exactly as built** — inviting a one-block edit, not a
  restart. (Productive failure, Kapur; the debug arc is *designed in*.)

## B4. The concept ladder — real CS learned by doing

A Brilliant-style **course = a short sequence of interactive lessons**; each lesson teaches **one concept**
by making it the *only way to win*, then lets the child feel it. The board forces the concept; the child
*discovers* the block (progressive disclosure — a new block shimmers into the palette exactly when the old
toolkit becomes insufficient). No lesson is gated by text.

| Course | Concept (real CS) | The board forces… | Block introduced | Signature work-mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Ways to Move** | **Sequence** — order matters | three cells in a line, then a corner | `Step`, `Turn`, `GO` | build |
| **2. Oops!** | **Debugging** — read a trace, find the one wrong step | a *pre-built broken* program that just misses | (uses existing) | **debug** |
| **3. Again & Again** | **Loops / iteration** — a tighter way | a long straight; slots "run out" | `Repeat N {…}` | build · investigate |
| **4. It Depends** | **Conditionals / branching** — sense & react | a fork; a locked gate needing a key | `If <sensor> {…} else {…}`, `Grab`/`Use` | build · investigate |
| **5. Remember** | **Variables / state** — count & recall | collect 3 seeds; a counter door | `Set`/`Change <var>` | build · debug |
| **6. Name It** | **Functions / abstraction** — name & reuse | repeat the *same* dance in 3 places | `Define <name> {…}` + call | compose · build |
| **7. When…** | **Events** — the world reacts | a switch that opens a far gate | `When <event> {…}` | build · investigate |
| **8. Make Your Own** | **Decomposition / composition** — your idea, your pieces | *nothing* — a blank goal | (all) | **compose** |

Two supporting **explorable widgets** (Brilliant-style, for concepts the bot-world teaches less crisply),
sharing the block palette + palette lock:
- **The Loop Machine** — drag a `Repeat` around blocks and *watch the sequence physically fold up*; scrub
  N and see the output grow. (Iteration made visible.)
- **The Logic Bench** — snap `If`/sensor tiles and flip switches to see a gate open/close in real time.
  (Boolean logic by direct manipulation.)

## B5. Lesson architecture — a lesson is a manipulable explanation

Each lesson is a tiny **explorable explanation**, not a slide:

1. **Invitation (≤1 short line + the live thing).** "Get Pip to the light." The world is already there,
   already touchable. No wall of rules.
2. **Do.** The child arranges blocks and presses GO. The concept is discovered by trying (World 1-1; the
   corner *proves* you need `Turn`).
3. **Feel the result.** Immediate, visible, delightful; success blooms; failure shows a ghost trail + the
   offending block — *invite a one-block fix*.
4. **A twist (optional stretch).** "Now do it in fewer blocks" / "now with a wall here" — a `CHOSEN_CHALLENGE`
   the child opts into, never forced.
5. **Keep it.** The solved program + trace + block-count is saved as a **real artifact** (§B7) and appears on
   the Shelf back in the room.

**Dosage & the disconnect right (Animal Crossing; IDC 2026).** Lessons are short; a course reaches a natural
**"good place to stop — the bench will be here"** endpoint; **guilt-free pause, no streak debt, definitive
exit.** The come-back loop lives *around* the app (the Shelf glow in the room), **never inside it**.

## B6. The four work-modes → content-app surfaces (the signal columns)

The v1 mapping is kept and made concrete per surface. `WorkMode` is the frozen nine-verb enum; Code uses
four (three shared to light cross-domain columns; `investigate` is Code's signature analytical column).

| Interaction (what the child does) | Surface | Canonical `WorkMode` | Shared with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **make / build** — assemble a program to reach a goal | Courses 1,3,4,5,7 | **`build`** | Music (make), Art (make) → strong shared column |
| **fix / debug** — correct a failed/broken run | Course 2 + any fail→fix | **`debug`** | Music (fix) → shared column |
| **solve / plan** — read/trace/predict *before* running; the Loop Machine / Logic Bench; "Peek/Trace" | Peek/Trace + explorable widgets | **`investigate`** | Code's signature column |
| **tinker / create** — free-play, author your own program/level/creature | Course 8 · Tinker Studio | **`compose`** | Art (compose), Music (compose) → shared column |

## B7. Artifacts (real, kept) + the Shelf seam

Every success produces a **real, kept artifact**, not a checkmark (passion research: grade the process /
keep the making; Evidence-Graph-friendly):

- **Solved lesson** = the child's **block program + run trace + block-count**, saved and shown as a **ribbon
  on the Shelf** ("★ solved in N blocks"). A tighter re-solve updates it (and is an `UNREQUIRED_REVISION`
  signal).
- **Tinker creation** = a **named, replayable program** ("Pip's Dance", "my star maze") saved as a `.bot`
  artifact; optionally **published** as a level for others to solve (audience) or built **with a friend**
  (group → carries a `SoloProof`).

**Persistence** per `learnerRef` via the core artifact store (`RoomProps.artifacts` / the engine's
`acceptArtifactSignal`; group → `promoteTeamArtifact` + `SoloProof`). **The Shelf is the seam's diegetic
memory:** kept/unfinished artifacts light the room's Shelf and the 2D building's `shelf-glow` on a later
visit — a single, gentle, opt-in return cue.

## B8. Content-app hard floors + banned outcomes

**Hard floors (Brilliant-quality, 2D):**

| Dimension | Floor |
|---|---|
| Text per lesson before the first interaction | **≤ 1 short line**; the live thing is on screen first |
| Primary action | exactly **1** obvious `GO` (nameable from the screenshot alone) |
| Blocks are tactile | snap + bounce (`resolveMotion` `pick`/`markerPop`); **never** a text field |
| Running feedback | the executing block **lights**; agent moves **one visible step at a time** |
| Failure | ghost trail + offending block pulse; **no buzzer, no red WRONG**; program preserved |
| Accepted solutions | **many** (any program that reaches the goal solves it; tighter is optional) |
| Concepts taught by doing | **≥ 6** of §B4's ladder shipped (sequence→functions) |
| Immediate result latency | run animation starts **< 150ms** after GO |
| Runs on | **every** Chromebook (no WebGL required for the content app) |

**Banned outcomes — instant fail (content app):**
- Any **multiple-choice quiz** / "what does this print?" / **"type this exact code"** / syntax typing.
- A **wall of instructions** or a tutorial modal before the child can touch anything.
- A **form-field feel**; tiny fiddly widgets; a code-editor look.
- **Chocolate-covered broccoli:** a generic drill wrapped in a coding theme where the theme is cosmetic.
- **One right answer only** (kills autonomy); punishing failure (buzzer / red WRONG / lives).
- **Streaks / points / XP / leaderboards / FOMO / a fixed label** ("you are a coder").
- A **dead GO** button; a "next" that erases the child's work; a result the child can't *see* happen.
- Text-heavy explanation *instead of* manipulation (the explorable-explanation violation).

## B9. Content-app accessibility — keyboard/SR block programming (first-class)

The content app is **2D-and-keyboard-first by construction**, so it *is* the deep-learning accessibility
floor (no 3D dependency). It preserves **the act of building logic**, not a to-do list:

- **Program = a real `<ol>`**; each slot an `<li>` (`role="listitem"`). Build by keyboard: focus a slot →
  choose a block from the **palette toolbar** (buttons) with Enter; **arrow keys reorder**; Delete removes;
  nested blocks (`Repeat`/`If`/`Define`) are nested lists. This is *genuine* block programming.
- **World = a described grid** (labeled table). SR reads state: *"Pip at B2 facing north; goal at D4; wall
  at C2; 1 seed at C4."* On GO, **each executed step is announced**: *"Step: Pip → B3", "Turn Left: faces
  west", "Bump: wall ahead — Pip waits."* The consequence is **watchable aurally**.
- **Failure announced non-punitively:** *"Pip stopped one short; step 3 sent it into a wall,"* and the
  offending `<li>` is flagged → the debug act is fully keyboard/SR operable.
- **Peek/Trace, Tinker Studio, Publish, Hint** all mirrored; the child still **chooses what to make and
  revisit**. Reduced-motion → instant step framing (agent "jumps" cell-to-cell with announced positions).
- **Parity by construction:** identical `probeId` / `workMode` / `kind` / `returnState` per `plainZoneEquals`
  / `plainViewEquals`; the keyboard path **emits the same `ActivityEvent`s** (Part C). Accessible Games
  Initiative / MS tags: move focus one item at a time (never steer a cursor); narrate name/role/state;
  WCAG 2.2 AA; color-independent.

## B10. Content-app self-score rubric + delta loop

Rows (`10/7/4/2` vs RF-C1/C2/C3): **"is it obviously hands-on (not a quiz) in <1s" · block tactility &
game-feel · immediate-result clarity (cause↔effect) · the aha (success delight) · warmth & whitespace
(Brilliant-quality) · failure feels safe & invites a fix · a real concept is *discovered by doing* · the
Tinker Studio feels like a toy · keyboard/SR parity · Chromebook smoothness.** Same delta loop: render →
side-by-side vs the reference lesson → `DELTA.md` top-10 → fix top-3 → re-render.

---

# PART C — THE SEAM (world ↔ app · signal · accessibility)

## C1. How the world opens the content app

**Handoff.** Activating `go-bench` in the 3D room (pointer/tap, keyboard Enter, or the world `ActivityDOM`
button) calls `openBench()`:
- The **shared persistent `<Canvas>` stays mounted** (canvas-persistence invariant); the room simply pauses
  its `frameloop="demand"`.
- The content app mounts as a **DOM + light-canvas surface layered over (or routed in place of) the room
  view** — e.g. app route `/#/zone/code/bench` or an in-shell overlay owned by the zone. It is **not** a new
  WebGL context (the content app's world panel is a 2D `<canvas>`/SVG).
- A short diegetic transition ("the blueprint unrolls") covers the swap; a clear **"← back to the workshop"**
  exit returns to the room (canvas resumes), landing the eye on the **Shelf** (now showing any new artifact).

**Why an embedded module, not a separate app:** it shares the `learnerRef`, the `emit` channel, the palette,
the artifact store, and the return cue (the Shelf) — so the *signal is unified* and the child feels one
place, two depths.

## C2. Signal capture across both layers (the two-level signal)

Both layers emit the **same** frozen `ActivityEvent` through the **same** `RoomProps.emit` → the core
`buildReturnGrid` → the `{domain:"computation", workMode}` grid. The novelty gate + prompted/voluntary split
live in the core; the zone never fabricates return events.

**Layer 1 — the Discovery World (topic-axis pull: "did they come back to *computation* at all?").**
- Entering the building / dwelling in the room / opening the bench on **first visit** = `kind:"explore"`
  (novelty; `dayOffset 0`) — **kept `EMERGING`, never confirms** (novelty guard).
- Returning to the Code Lab **unprompted at `dayOffset ≥ 7`** = the building revisit — the coarse
  voluntary-return signal (row-ish).
- Returning only after a reminder/nudge = `intervention` present → `promptedReturns` (tagged, excluded).

**Layer 2 — the Content App (work-mode-axis resolution: "*what kind of doing* did they come back to?").**
- Each deep action emits its `workMode` + `kind` (§C3), so returns resolve **per (domain, work-mode) cell** —
  this is what disambiguates a *topic* spike (stays in computation across build/debug/investigate) from a
  *work-mode* spike (composes in code **and** music **and** art). A child who keeps reopening the **Tinker
  Studio** across days lights the `compose` column; one who keeps reopening **debug** lessons lights `debug`.

**The crux:** the world layer tells you *they keep coming back to computation*; the content app tells you
*to which work-mode*. Together they place marks in the exact grid cells the hypothesis reads. **Deep
absorption is the target signal** (passion research): the child who loses track of time in the Tinker Studio
and doesn't want to stop is the highest-value read — surfaced as sustained content-app engagement +
voluntary return, **never** engineered by pressure and **never** gamified.

## C3. Action → `workMode` → `kind` → `EventType` (the full mapping)

Zones emit `ActivityEvent` (`kind`); the core `toEngagementEvents` bridges `kind` → the six `EventType`
families. (This replaces v1 §7's direct-`EngagementEvent` emit with the frozen contract.)

| # | Child action | Layer | Probe → `workMode` (column) | `ActivityEvent.kind` | Bridged `EventType` / why |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Approach/dwell in the room; open the bench (1st time) | World | `code.path` → build | `explore` | novelty — *no family event* (kept `EMERGING`) |
| 2 | Snap a block into the program | App | `code.path` → **build** | *(accrues)* | building the program = the *make* act |
| 3 | Press GO → agent reaches the goal (solved) | App | `code.path` → **build** | `artifact` | `ARTIFACT_COMPETENCE` — working artifact |
| 4 | After a failed run, edit a block & re-run to success | App | `code.debug` → **debug** | `recover` | `FAILURE_RECOVERY` — the debug arc |
| 5 | Open **Peek/Trace** / predict-then-run / a Logic-Bench read | App | `code.plan` → **investigate** | `artifact` (on a **verified** prediction) | `ARTIFACT_COMPETENCE` — the analytical act |
| 6 | Choose a **stretch** twist (fewer blocks / harder board / loops-required) | App | (that probe's) column | `challenge` | `CHOSEN_CHALLENGE` |
| 7 | Re-solve a solved lesson in **fewer blocks**, unprompted | App | `code.path` → **build** | `revise` | `UNREQUIRED_REVISION` |
| 8 | Enter **Tinker Studio** and set your own goal | App | `code.tinker` → **compose** | `author-scope` | `SELF_AUTHORED_SCOPE` |
| 9 | Save a Tinker creation (runnable `.bot`) | App | `code.tinker` → **compose** | `artifact` | `ARTIFACT_COMPETENCE` |
| 10 | **Publish** a creation / a level (audience) | App | `code.tinker.share` → **compose** | `artifact` (+`author-scope`) | shipped for an audience |
| 11 | Build a level **with a friend** (co-op) | App | `code.tinker.share` (group) → **compose** | `artifact` (+`SoloProof`) | team → solo-proof |
| 12 | Tap **Hint / "show me one block"** | App | (current probe) | `assist` | `ASSISTIVE` — **never lowers a signal** |
| 13 | Return to the Code Lab / a lesson days later, **unprompted** | World+App | zone/cell-level | `return` (`dayOffset≥7`, no `intervention`) | `VOLUNTARY_RETURN` — **the actual passion signal** |
| 14 | Return only after a reminder/nudge | World+App | zone/cell-level | `return` (+`intervention`) | `PROMPTED_RETURN` — recessed, ≠ signal |

**Novelty guard (non-negotiable):** first-session actions are `explore` (novelty) → keep the hypothesis
`EMERGING` and schedule a delayed return check; only the later, unprompted `return` (row 13) counts.
`assist` never raises or lowers signal. Promotion to a candidate spine needs ≥3 families including a
**delayed voluntary return** *and* an **artifact/competence** signal — i.e., *came back **and** made
something*, not novelty clicks.

## C4. Binding to the core — `ZonePlugin`, `RoomProps`, emit

```ts
// passion/packages/interest-zone-code/src/plugin.ts
import type { ZonePlugin, RoomProps } from "@gt100k/interest-zone-kit";
import type { ActivityEvent, Probe } from "@gt100k/interest-lab";

export const codeProbes: readonly Probe[] = [/* §B6 catalog, domain:"computation" (v1 §6, kept) */];

export const codeZone: ZonePlugin = {
  id: "code",
  domain: "computation",                 // grid row; hue via resolveDomainHue()
  mapBuilding: {                         // 2D Curiosity-Map building (§A2)
    label: "Code Lab",
    glyph: "gear-sprout",
    enterVerb: "Step inside",
    cell: { col: /* island slot */ 1, row: 0 },
    art: { sprite: "workshop" /*, hue derived */ },
  },
  Room3D: CodeRoom3D,                    // the cozy workshop diorama (Part A) — the DOORWAY
  ActivityDOM: CodeWorldActivityDOM,     // described-room a11y peer (§A8)
  probes: codeProbes,
};
```

The **content app** is a zone-owned module (`src/bench/…`) the room opens via the seam; it receives the same
`RoomProps` (`learnerRef`, `emit`, `artifacts`, `reducedMotion`, `dayOffset`, `plainMode`, `seed`) so both
layers share one `emit` channel and one artifact store. **Emit helper (frozen `ActivityEvent`):**

```ts
function mk(probe: Probe, kind: ActivityEvent["kind"], dayOffset: number): ActivityEvent {
  return { zoneId: "code", probeId: probe.id, domain: "computation",
           workMode: probe.workMode, action: `${probe.id}:${kind}`, kind, dayOffset };
}
const onSolved      = (p, d) => emit(mk(p, "artifact",      d)); // build column
const onFixedAfterFail = (p, d) => emit(mk(p, "recover",    d)); // debug column
const onVerifiedPlan   = (p, d) => emit(mk(p, "artifact",   d)); // investigate column
const onTinkerGoalSet  = (p, d) => emit(mk(p, "author-scope", d)); // compose column
const onHint        = (p, d) => emit({ ...mk(p, "assist", d), assistive: true });
```

Artifacts route through `RoomProps.artifacts` / `acceptArtifactSignal`; group creations through
`promoteTeamArtifact` with a `SoloProof` (else `TeamArtifactProofRequiredError`). **Return events are set by
the core map on revisit** (voluntary vs prompted) — the zone does not fabricate them.

## C5. `window.__qa` hooks across both layers (dead-primary-action proof)

Both layers must be provably alive to the upgraded gate (P0/P3a/P3b of the QA-harness research).

```ts
window.__qa = {
  ready, error, settle(frames = 2),
  scene,                                        // r3f state.scene (the room)
  primaryActionAlive: () => boolean,            // go-bench opens the bench && GO runs a program
  interactives: () => [
    { id: "go-bench", kind: "button", worldPos: [...] }, // the ONE room 3D interactive → opens app
    { id: "shelf",    kind: "target", worldPos: [...] }, // return cue
    // content-app: block palette, GO, tinker actions are DOM (covered by the DOM click-assert law)
  ],
  stateHash,        // room: {bench-open, shelf-count} · app: {program blocks, agent pose, solved}
};
```

**Gate round-trips (hard-fail if dead):** (1) project `go-bench` → dispatch a real pointer event → assert
`stateHash()` changed (bench opened) — the exact prior failure this prevents; (2) in the app, click `GO`
with a valid program → assert the agent pose / `solved` flag changed. A dead primary action at **either**
layer is an instant fail.

## C6. Accessibility seam (parity across world + app)

- The **world** `ActivityDOM` (§A8) and the **content app** keyboard/SR path (§B9) both expose the **same
  seam action** ("Step up to the Build Bench" → opens the bench) and both **emit the same `ActivityEvent`s**.
- `plainZoneEquals(domActions, model)` holds for the world layer; `plainViewEquals` parity holds for the
  content app's block actions. Reduced-motion honored in both. No child is routed to a lesser experience:
  the **full deep learning is 2D/keyboard-first**, so the a11y path reaches *the same concepts and the same
  artifacts* as the sighted 3D path.

---

# PART D — VERIFICATION & ACCEPTANCE

## D1. The verification battery (scripted, both layers)

Run at every phase close (mirrors LAAS §7 + the QA-harness gate):
1. **Reference-delta loop** — side-by-sides for RF-W1/W2/W3 (room) and RF-C1/C2/C3 (app); `DELTA.md`
   top-10; fix top-3; re-shoot.
2. **No-black-shadows test** (room) — sample shadowed wood/brass pixels; **0** desaturated-gray.
3. **Dressing-density test** (room) — count occupants in the hero framing ≥ 40; every surface class occupied.
4. **One-verb test** (room) — VLM rubric: "is there exactly one obvious primary action, nameable from the
   frame?" → the bench.
5. **Not-a-quiz test** (app) — VLM rubric: "in <1s, does this look hands-on (manipulable), not a test?"
6. **Dead-primary-action round-trip** — `go-bench` opens the bench; `GO` runs a program; both change
   `stateHash()` (hard fail if dead).
7. **Perf** — `< 50` draw calls at `room-3d`; clean degrade to lite → world `ActivityDOM`; content app smooth
   on a real Chromebook.
8. **Parity** — `plainZoneEquals` (world) + `plainViewEquals` (app); full keyboard/SR walk of the block
   editor; each path emits the correct `ActivityEvent`.
9. **Signal correctness** — seeded end-to-end: `explore` keeps `EMERGING`; solved → `ARTIFACT_COMPETENCE`;
   fail→fix → `FAILURE_RECOVERY`; stretch → `CHOSEN_CHALLENGE`; tinker goal → `SELF_AUTHORED_SCOPE`; hint =
   `ASSISTIVE` (lowers nothing); `dayOffset≥7` no-intervention → `VOLUNTARY_RETURN`.
10. **Reduced-motion** — instant framing in both layers; no essential motion.

## D2. Banned outcomes — consolidated (instant fail)

Room: §A9. Content app: §B8. Cross-cutting: **decorative 3D over a hidden menu · a dead primary action ·
gamifying the return signal · a fixed label · reading novelty as interest · the a11y path as a lesser menu ·
collapsing topic and work-mode into a per-zone read.**

## D3. Gated phase plan (each phase ends green: build · delta loop · fix top-3)

| Phase | Deliverable | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Scaffold zone pkg; wire `window.__qa`; assemble `/reference` (RF-W* + RF-C*) into the side-by-side tool | harness produces comparisons |
| **1** | Content-app substrate: world panel + block editor + GO + immediate result + safe failure (Courses 1–2) | RF-C1/C2 delta; not-a-quiz test; GO round-trip |
| **2** | Content-app concept ladder Courses 3–7 + Peek/Trace + Loop Machine / Logic Bench | ≥6 concepts by doing; investigate emits |
| **3** | Tinker Studio (Course 8) + artifacts + Save/Publish/co-op | RF-C3 delta; compose/author-scope/SoloProof |
| **4** | Content-app a11y: keyboard/SR block editor + described world + parity | full SR walk; `plainViewEquals` |
| **5** | 3D room shell + lighting + palette + one shading model + HDRI + shadows (RF-W1) | no-black-shadows; palette cohesion |
| **6** | Room dressing to the floor (≥40 occupants, ≥3/ surface class) + motion (≥4) + the bench (RF-W2) | dressing-density; one-verb; motion |
| **7** | The seam (openBench/exit, canvas persistence, Shelf), world `ActivityDOM`, 2D building (RF-W3) | seam round-trip; `plainZoneEquals` |
| **8** | Perf pass + tiers/degrade + full battery + final delta loop | §D1 all green; §D5 |

## D4. Zone acceptance (land green)

(1) All probes registered, `domain:"computation"`, four distinct work-modes (build/debug/investigate/
compose). (2) Content app teaches **≥6** concepts **by doing** (no quiz, no typing), with immediate visual
results and safe failure. (3) Seeded end-to-end signal per §D1.9. (4) Both a11y paths pass parity + full
keyboard/SR walk and emit identical `ActivityEvent`s; the deep learning is reachable with **zero 3D**. (5)
Room `< 50` draw calls at `room-3d`, clean degrade; **≥40** occupants; no-black-shadows; one obvious verb.
(6) `window.__qa` present; `go-bench` and `GO` round-trips change `stateHash()`. (7) Reduced-motion instant.
(8) Register the plugin (the single shared-root merge point) and run the upgraded QA gate.

## D5. Final acceptance — the two-frame + one-flow test (LAAS-style)

Produce **two frames** and **one flow**, each beside its reference:
- **Frame 1 (world):** the RF-W1 sunlit maker's nook — if a viewer's eye doesn't snag within one second on
  a *category* error (bare surfaces, gray shadows, cloned props, no obvious verb), the room has done its job.
- **Frame 2 (app):** the RF-C1 Brilliant-style lesson mid-manipulation — if in one second it reads as a
  *hands-on thing you touch* (not a quiz/editor), the app has done its job.
- **Flow (the seam):** enter the building → walk to the glowing bench → open the Build Bench → arrange
  blocks → GO → the goal blooms → back to the workshop → the new creation is on the Shelf. If a child can
  do this with **no tutorial text**, discovers a real concept **by doing**, and the run emits the right
  `{domain:"computation", workMode}` events, the zone is done. Until then, iterate the delta loop.

## Appendix — anti-patterns explicitly designed out (v2)

| Anti-pattern | How v2 avoids it |
|---|---|
| **Decorative 3D over a hidden menu** | The room's `go-bench` is a live 3D interactive in `__qa.interactives()` and opens a *real* deep app; the room is never `aria-hidden`-only. |
| **Quiz behind a pretty door** | The content app has **no quiz** — the mechanic (arrange logic → run → watch → fix) *is* the learning; many solutions accepted. |
| **"Type this exact code"** | Zero typing/syntax; big tactile icon-blocks; keyboard path is genuine block programming. |
| **Chocolate-covered broccoli** | Intrinsic integration + explorable explanations: the concept is the *only way to win* and the result is immediate. |
| **The room as the whole activity (v1)** | Split: the room is the *doorway*; the deep learning is the Brilliant-style app opened from it. |
| **3D that subtracts legibility** | Cozy fixed camera, one obvious verb; the deep learning is 2D-first and runs everywhere; lite/DOM are genuine equals. |
| **Gamifying the return signal** | No streaks/points/XP/FOMO; `welcome-back` is warmth only; guilt-free "done for today"; Shelf glow is opt-in. |
| **A fixed label** | Emits separated families via the frozen bridge; never "you are a coder." |
| **Novelty mistaken for interest** | First-session = `explore` (novelty), keeps `EMERGING`; only delayed unprompted `return` counts. |
| **Topic/work-mode collapse** | Two-level signal: the world says *came back to computation*; the app says *to which work-mode* — read per (domain × work-mode) cell. |
| **A11y path as a lesser menu** | The 2D/keyboard content app is the *full* deep learning; parity by construction; same artifacts. |
