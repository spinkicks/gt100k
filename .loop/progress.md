# Loop progress (durable memory the agent maintains each turn)

## NEXT
- Begin P0. Read only the PRD section for the current phase.

## 2026-07-20 — P0 / T001
- Added `packages/arena-world/package.json` for `@gt100k/arena-world`, mirroring the existing pure-domain package contract.
- Declared only the required `@gt100k/learning-loop: workspace:*` dependency; no 3D or renderer dependency entered the domain package.
- Verified the manifest contract test-first: the absence assertion failed before creation, then the exact field/dependency assertions passed.
- Gate status: `pnpm typecheck` passed; `pnpm test` passed (4 files, 14 tests).
- SC status: P0 remains in progress; no feature success criterion is claimed by this scaffold-only increment.
- Blockers: none.

## NEXT
- T002: add `packages/arena-world/tsconfig.json` extending `../../tsconfig.base.json`, with `composite: true`, `rootDir: "."`, `outDir: "dist"`, and includes for `src/**/*.ts` and `test/**/*.ts`; keep `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` green.
