# Loop decisions — what was chosen and why (do not re-litigate)

## D001 — Package-local Vitest discovery
- Chose: add `packages/interest-lab/vitest.config.ts` with `test/**/*.test.ts` discovery while preserving the spec-pinned `"test": "vitest run"` script.
- Why: filtered package scripts execute from the package directory, so the shared root config's `packages/**` include discovers no tests; the reference `@gt100k/learning-loop` filter fails the same way.
- Rejected: editing the shared root Vitest config violates feature isolation; changing the pinned test script would diverge from T001.
